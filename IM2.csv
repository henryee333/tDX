7/17/17 23:52,dnlchang@berkeley.edu,Chang,Daniel,No,No,"This method seems quite useful for broader topics and helps to narrow down the rationales for people's actions, but may not be the most suitable for more specific problems where the rationales may be more apparent. In our case, I believe something that extends the scope a bit broader may be more useful.",No,No,"Since we largely chose to focus on younger adults and college students, I feel an empathy map is not as valuable as our target demographic is already one which we greatly relate to. However, if we were working with a less familiar demographic, this would be invaluable for understanding their perhaps differing motives and perspectives.",No,No,"Spectrum mapping, focusing on varying user's views, does not always seem to be the most relevant in this case as the problems we are considering tackling may not necessarily have such an extensive diversity of perspectives thus limiting the ability of this mapping technique.",No,No,"While this method has some potential, our current level of research may be too broad for this method to function effectively. It may not be feasible to categorize all our points against 2 axes with the current lack of breadth. This would perhaps be useful in the near future, but the list as options that may be more valuable. ",No,No,"This was an option I strongly considered but I chose to use the power of ten method instead which is also a form of reframing, so more there.",No,Yes,"With our current research and problem we identified, the perceived solutions fall into a fairly narrow category. Through power of ten and reframing the issue, perhaps the new perspectives could help us to increase our diversity of potential opportunities.",No,No,"Without a clear product or service at this point, this method is not particularly relevant. As we develop something more concrete, perhaps this method will be worth revisiting in evaluating any potential gaps withing our product or service. ",Yes,Yes,"This method, being more cooperative, I feel would help improve our team synergy and decentralize the ideas emerging.  I think by forming the how might we questions, we would also better be able to check our assumptions about the issue and ensure that we do not take a path that is too narrow - a problem I am concerned with currently.",No,No,"I think the largest downfall of this method is that it may be difficult to share, which erodes the value of a team environment. Furthermore, I do no think we have the data that would make sense in being organized in such a fashion.",No,No,"This method was a strong contender, but I think since our demographic is similar to us, we already have a strong understanding of the context in which we operate. If we sough to expand to new markets, then this would perhaps be a top priority.",No,No,"I feel like this functions similarly to open card sorting, and I feel that the trends revealed are often heavily biased as the design team is the one creating the categories. As such, the themes may not always be relevant.",No,No,"I have not yet identified a super complex system that needs this level of breakdown within the topics we are working on. I think, to break down our current topic to this level could be potentially confusing as it would break down a fairly intuitive problem.",No,No,"This method seems as if it would be difficult to understand given its non-linear organization.  As such, the trends it may reveal may not be readily apparent and also may be difficult to share with other team members.",No,Yes,"While this method was initially hard to understand and seems difficult to implement, as we move towards a more concrete design solution, I think the flows of the product or service it reveals will be helpful in seeing each team member's idea of the produce along with providing a clear understanding of how our product is meant to be used- which may help us evaluate better its effectiveness in how users' operate it.",No,No,I think achieving a specific task is not necessarily the primary focus point for us as much as evaluating how external factors may influence the ability or interest in fulfilling the task.,No,No,"While, I did not choose this method due it perhaps being less useful to me because of its dependence on inference, it seems like it would be a useful analysis once we fully determined the features of our product.

7/18/17 12:36,tyfeng@berkeley.edu,Feng,Ty,Yes,Yes,"Why-how laddering nicely complements 1:1 interviews, which is a research method that our team chose in week 1. It allows 1:1 interviews to be more in-depth, provoking users to tell deeper stories with emotions and feelings. As we learned in week 1, human's emotional needs or pains are as important as functional needs. We also make decisions based on our emotions instead of the practical. Thus, understanding users on a deeper and more emotional level allow me to develop solutions that fulfill those emotional needs.",No,Yes,"Empathy map is a great tool for finding and defining ideal customer personas. However, what made me to choose this method is the emotional benefits of this method, rather than its functionalities. Empathy map and empathizing with the user bring me closer to the user, connecting me with the user emotionally. This emotion connection not only builds up the necessary trust between me and the users for them to feel safe to share personal information, it also makes interview sessions much more enjoyable for both users and interviewers. When I feel emotionally connected to users, I would not feel that I'm working, but rather it is for fun. It can boost my productivity tremendously. ",Yes,No,"Spectrum mapping, though helpful for group members to voice their diverse opinions, is not a relevant method for this class project. It is not very effective for a team that consists of less than 15 people. This method is mostly used by large groups because of the difficulties between team members to effectively communicate with each other and voice their opinions. In a group of four, communication is not a common problem, and we all have our fair share of participation in our meetings. ",Yes,Yes,"2x2 matrix is a great tool to organize thoughts, insights, and ideas in a visual and categorized diagram. For our team to truly come up with an innovative product or solution, we need to find opportunities for innovation, and 2x2 matrix is a great tool for that since it illustrates trends, areas of saturation and scarcity. ",Yes,No,"A key benefit with this method is that it adds empathetic focus to the design, and it helps overcome roadblocks by shifting POV. At the moment, my team have not hit a roadblock yet, and we have always had the empathetic focus since we are using empathy map. ",No,No,"Similar to reframing, Powers of Ten works best at times when I need to overcome roadblocks and proceed in a problem. While it can be useful down the road, at this time it is not the most relevant method because I still have much more research needed to be done linearly, instead of constantly shifting my focus. ",No,Yes,"Customer Journey Mapping is a great tool to visualize and analyze users_„Ž interaction experiences with a product or solution. What made me to choose this method is its ability to tell a vivid story of the users in a highly visual way. Story-telling is the most powerful way to introduce our solution to the users, build up our brand, and successfully market our products.

I see it as a way to carry on the system thinking in AEIOU to the analyzing stage. By understanding the key components, I can reorganize them into a more effective and efficient system.",No,No,"Concept mapping is another way to organize information as it connects concepts with linking words. While it can be used to create breadth, the cons of this method include its limited depth of research involved. I find delving into a topic in depth would help me to understand the root of a problem, while concept mapping, which only delves into a topic on the surface level, would not expose the root of a problem.",Yes,Yes,"Touchpoints matrix is a great way to compare different configurations, interfaces, and results of interactions with a system.

I have not ever named this process but have certainly worked with it in my design process. Understanding why  person does things where they go and why they go there, these small and large pieces of a persons day give you a great starting point for creating space, places, and interactions for that individual or group. Sometimes you discover things in their life that work really well and the things that work hooribly. either way as a design method it is a creative means of empathizing with your subject and also actively understanding the struggles of a persons/subjects day in a creative and interactive way.",Yes,No,I have used this method previously although I did not use it in the current project it has been useful in the past in gathering insight and a wide variety of input on a topic. As a method it is visual and allows participants to offer their opinions without fear of criticism.

7/18/17 1:57,rosemin@berkeley.edu,Min,Rose,No,Yes,"This is a very suitable for my team's research phase, as we chose 1:1 interview to gain insights from students. From our first week of starting to interview some subjects, we realized that students tend to give short and generic answers instead of going deep to the root of what they might be talking about. I feel that this method could be very practical and useful to implement in the current challenge that we face during the 1:1s. It is also an unnoticeable way for our interviewees for us to dig deep to their pain points and potential gain points. It is also good for establishing an understanding that we are invested into this interview instead of just doing it for the sake of it. ",No,No,"Empathy map seems like it requires quite a bit of time in order to follow up with our subject. Given the short time frame of this very project, it'd be hard for the whole team to collectively put in the time to brainstorm and follow up about the same subjects every time. Because the the why-how laddering also generates insights, we'd rather interact with our interviewees directly and pose questions directly to them instead of inferring what they might have meant. This is also because they are accessible on campus.   ",No,Yes,"I believe this is a method that our team needs right now. First because I do not feel like our team is communicating as often as we should be and there are some silent members during discussion. The spectrum mapping, on one hand, makes everyone on the same page about how we analyze the subjects and categorize them, and on the other hand, eases communication and thoughts within a team. Because the method demands the team's collective effort and therefore promotes everyone's voicing his/her opinion. I believe team this method could immensely help with our team collaboration. In short, not only would it help us organize our research results, but it will also help our teamwork.  ",No,No,"We have identified a few categories and challenges that new students face at Cal, and those include social, academic, and cultural. A 2x2 matrix would only be able to help us capture two of the three at each time and therefore making it a little unsuitable for the current research we are conducting. ",No,No,"Because we are focusing on a group of subjects that we are highly familiar with, interact with on a daily basis, and we even represent most of the categories, we are already able to see things in a perspective that's similar to theirs. Reframing is obviously very useful for a situation unlike ours. However, this methods did remind us to keep an open mind to different perspective and not to be too narrow minded when we are analyzing the research results. ",Yes,No,"Again, this is a method that's meant to help us change our perspectives on looking at our case. However, as previously mentioned, we are already students and we have been in the incoming students' shoes not long ago and some of us are actually experiencing it now. I believe that these two methods do remind us to be mindful of perspectives, but I do not think it is what our team needs the most right now. ",No,No,"Again because we are rather familiar with an average student's daily life, we probably would not want to go out of our way to make this customer journey map. I see that if we do enough mapping of different subjects, eventually we may identify some deep universal pain points that we have missed during interviews and prior research. However, this is where the time restriction plays as another giant obstacle to keep us from gaining insights through this method. If we do this, we probably want to do at least 5 to be able to compare and contrast, but I can see making one already taking so long, so this method is probably not the best choice for our current project. ",No,Yes,"I believe this method stimulates further insightful team discussion, which is what we really need as a team right now. By asking HMW in the team, we are going to be able to share our perspectives, experience, and understanding toward different research result; we are also going be able to step out side of our perspectives temporarily, combine them, and potentially generate really useful insights that can only be the result of a team perspective. It is also more flexible on time, as we can choose how deep and long we go for all the questions.  ",No,No,"I believe mind map is a powerful method to help the team keep track of our research result. However, in our research, I do not predict that we would get an amount of data so large that we need a systematic method like the mind map to help us keep track. However, the principle of a mind map can definitely be implemented to how we take and analyze our interview notes.  ",No,Yes,"I think it should be implemented because it is really easy for us to get caught in the details of this research and forget about the bigger picture. This method would help us picture the personas better because we will be able to put the people into context and have a more comprehensive understanding about their thought process and what they are feeling. I believe this is useful because as mentioned in the lecture, we are designing and ""selling"" the product to the market, and we have to understand the market and cater toward the wants and needs of them instead of what we as ""designers"" assume.  ",No,No,"This is not among my top three because, although useful and practical, it requires long team meetings for us to figure all our ideas about a research out, and because of our different schedules and limited availability, this method would not be the best option for us to ease up our team communication or insight-gaining from subjects.  ",No,No,"Because of its time-consuming limitation, it would be hard again for us to implement this method given our time frame. Although we should probably try to do that one or two times to identify any possibly common traits that's in the experience of our subjects. ",No,No,"The concept map for our subjects may become very tangled as there are so many aspects of life to new college students that they might find hard. It might take time, which we do not have much, to untangle it and actually figure out all the logic behind the arrows. Also, one of its limitations include that the results stay at the surface level, so we would probably like some methods which help us gain/infer insights. ",Yes,No,"This method, according to the description on the website, is obviously really useful in building a comprehensive persona and is very useful in understanding the potential market. However, the time-consuming nature of the method (that we have to identify the touch points and connect them to subjects and the persona) prevented us from selecting it just out of practical reasons for our project.",No,No,"Because it is task oriented method, it would be a little hard for the team to decide which student task to further look into. Because students have so many things going on in their lives, including clubs, school, interships, social experience, and so forth, a single task analysis is probably not sufficient to represent the whole group, or even one subject in our case.  ",No,No,"The method evaluates the effects of some products, but because we have not yet have a product in mind, it'd be hard for us to use this method, especially when we are trying to come up with something new. This method does not allow us to discover potential new features that we can give our product. ",,,4,,
7/16/17 16:07,mcreese@berkeley.edu,Reese,Michael,No,No,"While I really like the idea of why-how laddering, I think using this method in the context of our team's design challenge will be a bit redundant, as most of the 'why' questioning was actually conducted during several of our team's interviews. Of course, given more time further investigation into underlying behaviors would be most welcome, but given our constrains I would recommend conducing analysis in another, less explored sector such as the process of answering these why questions( process analysis).",No,Yes,"Our initial research has allowed our team to construct at least semi-accurate personas and has given us an idea of what type of user we are designing for. Therefore, I think that the use of an empathy map would allow the team to take an even closer look at the needs/pain points of our user segment and help us to get a better feel for the problems our users are facing. I really like how the empathy map combines aspects of the whole process, not just the simply _„ƒwhy_„Ž or _„ƒhow_„Ž like why-how laddering but also incorporates inferred feelings and thoughts of the consumer. I believe that this will help the team place themselves in the users_„Ž shoes and give us a clear head and an excellent feel for the project that will overall assist with further methods of analysis. Thus, I feel that the empathy map creates a great starting point for us to build on the insight that we have achieved during our initial research, and put the team in the right mindset for further analyze the insights that we have collected.",No,No,"While I think that Spectrum mapping could be useful in some contexts, I believe that the issues and perspectives that we are dealing with our our design challenge do not neatly fit in a spectrum, as many have overlapping concerns and solutions. Therefore, I feel that aligning our observations in a spectrum is not the most effective way of organizing our data, hence my decision to decline using this method.",Yes,No,"The 2x2 matrix is certainly useful(I've used it quite frequently) but where I feel it falls short is in comparing ideas and products in more than two dimensions. As with our market, their needs are not necessarily well placed along a spectrum that can be condensed easily into two categories. Therefore, I feel that it would be beneficial to use a method that better captures the depth of our project.",No,No,"Reframing is a great way to reexamine a problem, but I think for this specific project, it is more important for us to get a more concrete idea on how we are to proceed in the future. It is difficult to reframe an idea that has not been solidified yet, so I think it would be beneficial to save reframing for a later date. ",No,No,"Again, I believe that at this stage of the design process, reframing will actually do more harm than good considering the state of our product. It is more important for us now to syenthize information and dig deeper into consumer insights, especially considering that the power of 10 methodology is not easily applicable to our products design process at the current time.",No,Yes,"Customer journey mapping is a great way to really understand the consumer experience and a great complement to Empathy mapping by making the observations conducted there into a charted, tangible product that helps delineate the consumer experience. The customer journey map is a great way to identify gaps, gaps that we can fill with our product. By understanding these failures of the system in relation to our users, I believe the customer journey map will help us to create a real, worthwhile product that fits real needs. It also is a great way to take our earlier research further, and will help organize our though by focusing us on these pain points that are more easily visible with the aid of a customer journey map. Therefore, I think the customer journey map will be particularly helpful as an organizational tool that lends further insights using our past research as a foundation to make solid conclusions about our users.",Yes,No,"The reasons why I have declined to select How Might We is because our team has already completed much of this processes following our research portion. Thus, I think it would be beneficial to employ other methods first, and then revisit How Might We in the context of incorporating these insights at a later date.",No,No,"Given more time and the ability to select more than three methods, I would definitely choose mind mapping. However, for our specific project I think empathy mapping better fits our needs and provides just as good, if not better organization.",No,No,"I think context mapping is great tool, but given time constraints I feel that Consumer Journey mapping is more experience focused and provides at least a good, comprehensive view of the system that we can work with during our design phase. Given this, I think context mapping would be a great additional resource, but must be eliminated due to time constraints.",No,No,"Affinity diagramming is useful, but I feel that there are more comprehensive ways to organize data(such as the concept map). In this regard, I would rather conduct organization that is more comprehensive and takes a more exhaustive approach to visually showing the relationship between all stakeholder than conduct many small affinity diagrams that are ultimately limited in their ability to prompt conclusions.",Yes,No,"This one was a difficult choice and I'm actually going to encourage our team to do this anyway (: I think that atomizing is really important in breaking down a system, and especially considering that our team wants to launch a product in an incredibly complex ecosystem. However, my decision to turn down this method comes from the fact that it can be integrated into Concept Mapping, making for a hybrid method that covers both ends of the spectrum and provides useful insights. ",Yes,Yes,"The concept map would be a great tool to enhance the organization of our team_„Žs information. What I really like about it is it can be made a simple or as complex as you want and can incorporate a lot of different mapping methods by breaking down the actors in the concept map. I think for our team, considering the many different stakeholders that are present in our ecosystem, a concept map (as opposed to a mind map) would really help to visually break down all the different relationships between the different stakeholders. I think the overall people underestimate the power of the concept map because it is based on generality. However, I believe you can actually go further by detailing below the actors what they are, their core components, and their pain points involved in the underlying process. The concept map is a versatile tool that can be made as complex or as simple as necessary, which would provide our team a great, time effective way of incorporating many analysis methods into one comprehensive platform.",No,No,"I think the touch point matrix is a great way of outlining the consumer experience, but I feel that the Consumer Journey map provides more detail and is more focused on the experience. For our project, I think we need a more comprehensive method that focuses on the persona's experiences, thus why I have opted for Consumer Journey maps over the touch point matrix. ",No,No,"I think the main limitation with task analysis is that it is intensely focused on one task and really breaks it down into its component parts. However, for our project we have a system in which users are attempting to fulfill many tasks simultaneously, which would make it difficult and time consuming to separate and conduct individual task analysis on each of the tasks. Therefore, I feel that other methods offer better overview that would more easily fit within out time constraints. ",No,No,"I think the kano analysis is an essential tool, but is necessary at a later step of the design process. I feel that it is better to select methods that would help us better formulate what features we should make available before further sorting them into sub categories.
