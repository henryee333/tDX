8/10/2017 19:49:13,Team 1,Design Roadmap,      Our team has some confusion and uncertainty of our product and Roadmapping is useful when we need to consolidate results and extract insights. So we choose this method to help us clarify our targeted function and potential users. Roadmapping also really helps with planning ahead for future applications and improvements we can make on our product. ,"   After the second peer review, we received some feedback from potential users and professors that throwing out the trash is just a gain but not a necessary need for undergraduates students. Using roadmapping, we were able to identify other limitations and issues with our product such as the need for a sorting feature and the lack of awareness for environmental and waste management of our users. Roadmapping can help us think step by step, recognizing our original thought and then expand to future development.",Storyboards,"	Through group discussion, our team agreed that using a visual method like storyboarding  is great for outlining out our presentation to help us create a roadmap of our ideas. It’s great for using in the initial process of planning out a presentation","	When choosing the storyboarding method, our team took into consideration the benefits of having a visual in communicating our ideas and process. Since storyboard involves creating a roadmap of our ideas and implementation process, it’s very useful for planning out our presentation. As indicated on the DesignExchange website, Storyboard is used as a tool to help you visualize and organize your ideas into coherent presentation. It’s essential for us to tell a story through our presentation as it is more engaging for the audience and effective to get our message across. We also considered the method because it allows for everyone in the team to contribute to the process.  ",7 Ps Framework, The team agreed that this method would clearly show our product and design process in presentation. We also felt that the 7-Ps Framework would be the perfect method to let us gain a clearer understanding of our main goal in limited time.," Since we have been through our design process for five weeks, 7-Ps Framework can work as a checklist for us to organize our concepts and procedure before our final review. We can check what we lose and what else we can add on our project to make sure that we make everything perfect in the end. And since we are still not pretty sure about our targeted customers and marketing strategy, this method can help us have more concrete decision.","Envisionment Video:
	Our team considered using the envisionment video method for our communication module because it provides a visual for our presentation but due to the time restraints associated with this class we thought it best to choose a method that wouldn’t be so time consuming.

8/10/2017 23:23:10,Team 2,Personas,"Our team made up a character to better improve our products. His name is John and is 65 years old. He lives in a nursing home but his children are working abroad, so thus he can’t get daily care by his children. He has heart disease and has to take medicine every-day. He has got one medicine box now but its function is inefficient. It doesn’t have notification functions and can only store medicines for five days. Also refilling it can be difficult, because John has to take it to the doctor. John then hope to have one medicine box with multi-functions. He want it notify him to take pills when he has to, because he always forgets to take after having fun poker games with his old friends. ","With module design, the medicine storage can be extended, and thus John has to refill it less. Using smart notification, the medicine box will play loud music and emit light to tell John it’s time to take medicine. Using phone apps, doctors and his children can clearly see whether he is on track. If not, the doctor will visit him and see if anything is wrong.  When it’s empty, John can press the Botton on it and later the doctor will come to refill it. The box also has location system. When it’s lost, the location can be seen on apps.
	With the box, John will never forget to take medicines and can easily receive help from doctors. His health condition can be ensured, so thus we achieved better treatment.",Design Roadmap,We wanted something that can track our process and help us firgure out what we have achieved so far. Design Roadmap is kind of method that can help us achiece this. It's kind of like a map journey we can use sketches and drawings  to show our thinkings.,"The factor we consider is easy to express how we think. By using this method, you can draw or even put photos together like a collage. When we are doing our project, the most imortant thing is to express your ideas really quick and exact. Also, it will be really great to track what you've done up till now to walk through your team's thinking progress at the end of the design. This also will help you finding out what's wrong with your design.",7 Ps Framework,"It has a lot to do with purpose, product, people, process, pitfalls, prep, and practical. All of these Ps are really important when you are doing a design. You need to find out your users and their needs to achieve your goal. Also you need to get preparations and finally test it. All these contributes to a great design. So we decide on this method that can help us attain all these goals.","When we are choosing methods, we think that this method is really comprehensive and it includes all the information that we need to know and talk about. This method is like a guideline for us to develop our design.",
8/10/2017 22:53:05,Team 3,Composite Characters,"Our group firstly consider the university of our product, we hope our product could be widely applicable among international students in Berkeley. Michael figured out that composite character could help us consider multiple personas. Then we decide to use composite character to extend the character of our persona “MIng”. ","Our team elected to use a composite character as we felt it was the most natural progression from that of the persona which helped to inform a significant portion of the design process.Considering how a product has evolved to suit the needs of many users, a composite character would allow us to synthesize many of the existing characteristics of our multiple personas in order to better provide context to the presentation.  A composite character would relay a clear understanding of the consumer that we are designing for and help to place our product’s features in a convenient juxtaposition with our product thus helping to tell the story of where features originated from and why they are relevant. In this way, the composite character can serve as a centralized guide from which the presentation is based, and via our constant relation to the character, our team can endeavor to create a clear link between the product and the consumer. As such, a composite character would be an excellent organizational tool, hence why our team has elected to select it.
",Storyboards,"At very beginning, our team opted to using storyboards as one of  our communication methods just due to the talent of Imani. She is really good at drawing. Storyboards is a good way to show her capacity and get everyone involved in group communication. Everyone could have fun in this process. Second, storyboard could cooperate with our model built last class to present the core function of our product.
","The two primary reasons that our team decided to select the Storyboards was because of its explicitness and its explanatory power in presenting our product. We want the communication process could build connection with the model we built in build process. In last class, we use Adobe Illustrator build our main function for our product. But the picture could not directly present the user experience and feeling in practical application. We think storyboard which gives a holistic view of all user-touch points could present the true feeling of users to verify our functions. Furthermore, this method is extremely fun, could  inspire the  group involvement. The process of making storyboards is an interactive activity, we were all worried about the poor “Hugo” when he does not have the Visual Berkeley.His feeling becomes actual and touchable, 
",Design Roadmap,"Our team decided to use Design road mapping as our communication method. Make this decision is tough. After gust lecture, Danielle talked a lot of methods for communication，specially introduced design road mapping method. Michael like this method. He said he familiar with project management and gold setting and he can do this well. However，Hogo don't like this method. He said this method is very hard to operation compared with other method. But our team loves challenge，the more difficult problems are，the more interesting we are. And this method really suitable to our subject. So we choice this method.","Danielle told us that the primary benefit of the design roadmapping method is that it promotes an active communication across participants to build their unique and structured plans for the future in phases from near to long. And design roadmpping is a map allow us to notice what the international students who is new in Berkeley really need. What's more, This new approach creates roadmaps driven by innovations from the perspective of future customers, instead of solely by technology projections.  This method of communication will provoke us to a headed discussion.  And in this way we can see our expectations for the next year.",
8/10/2017 21:32:11,Team 4,Personas,"Since we had used personas in our role play assignment, it was a logical extension to continue using it as a form of communication
","We believe that personas are important in that they demonstrate our understanding of our customer base. Furthermore, once the initial basis is there, it allows us to clearly demonstrate how we may attend to the customer/user’s needs",Storyboards,We wanted to ensure we included at least 1 visual communication method as they tend to be more engaging and efficient.,"As mentioned above, we valued the visual aspect of storyboarding - it offers a useful way of communicating within the team as well as customer without the miscommunication potential with words. Storyboarding also allows the display of detail that again is not possible with words.
",Usability Report,"Our team found this method interesting in how it expressed direct user feedback and thus wanted to incorporate this into our project. 
","As mentioned previously, this method directly addresses user feedback. I think this is particularly valuable for our group as a lot of our design choices were based around the information we learned from our interviews. As such, the usability report seemed like a perfect method to convey what we learned from the interview and how we addressed it. 
",
8/9/2017 15:07:28,Team 5,Envisionment Videos,A few of us chose this method in our individual method surveys and we all agreed to it.,We have members in our group that have experience in communicating through videos so this method was a good fit for us. Creating a video will allow us to gain insight into our customer's experience by envisioning what the usage of our product will look like. ,Service Blueprint,Someone suggested this method and others agreed in a team chat.,"This method makes sense to use because our product is both tangible and digital, offering different features which address a multitude of pain points. It would allow us to better organize our features and center our business around understanding our customer's experiences.",Design Roadmap,We had a team discussion and readily agreed to this method.,Our group has members which are apt at storytelling through visual charts and diagrams and this method would help us gain further insights from our user research. This method also makes sense to use at this stage in our design process given our lack of time because it focuses on augmenting our current features and designs rather than re-designing.,
8/11/2017 13:09:24,Team 6,Design Roadmap,We quickly agreed on using a design roadmap as we had just started this in class. We asked ourselves which methods we wanted to use and we all agreed upon using this method. ,"We believed that this is a great method to showcase our process of analyzing the observed data and quotes and converting them into actionable design decisions. It allowed us to sort our design journey into three threads, each corresponding to a unique customer/user segment, and it clearly showed how we responded to the unique challenges and contexts of each user group.
",Storyboards,"As a group, we discussed which all methods we had available to us and which methods we had chosen for our individual surveys and then came to a consensus on using a storyboard after light discussion.
","We believed that this would be a great method to illustrate different scenarios that our product would be involved in and how it would work. We also thought we could put a twist on it by creating an interactive storyboard so the audience could experience the situation in a more first person context in order to induce more empathy. This would allow us to be more convincing since it forces users to be put onto the spot and experience the scenario themselves. This method would clearly communicate the problems that we are trying to solve and how important it is. 
",Composite Characters,"As a group, we discussed which all methods we had available to us and came to a consensus on using composite characters after light discussion after realizing this was different enough from the other methods in order to not be redundant. 
","We believe that composite characters would help the audience understand what we are trying to achieve by empathizing with the user. We quickly realized that this method could also be used very well with a storyboard in order to make a very effective combination of the two. Since we talked to a lot of potential users with similar traits and backgrounds, we find it easier to composite a character than to focus on one specific character which is required in building personas.
