7/20/17 21:40,Team 1,Empathy Map,"All members of the team unanimously decided to use empathy map as one of our analysis methods in order to empathize and better understand the struggles of our customersâ€™ lives. After doing initial research, this method can help us organize observations and gain deeper insights.","Since we are aiming to help alleviate some of our customerâ€™s personal health concerns, we felt that empathizing with them would allow us to better understand the causes for their poor health and therefore create better pain relievers for our customers. This method is great for gaining a different perspective since it allows us to put ourselves in our userâ€™s shoes.",Affinity Diagramming,"The members in our group are all creative, and the method are suggested to use in situations when every team member has different opinions on how to proceed. So, we choose this method to help solicit ideas from our group and obtain consensus on how information should be structured. The method helps us to figure out the idea, as well as their importance. ","After out 1:1 interviews, our team had a lot of information to try and sift through, thus we selected the affinity diagram method to sort through all this information and find common themes in the information the interviewees were relaying to us. After sorting a large amount of data into logical groups, we can figure out clearer ideas for  next stage.",Concept Map,"After considering other methods for analysis, our team agreed the best method for our project would be Concept mapping. Although there are other methods similar to concept mappings, we felt that they did not provide as broad of a horizon on the issue or as deep insights as concept mapping.",Our main motivator for choosing concept mapping as one of our analysis methods was to have a visual representation of how the information our prospective customers were relaying to us. By having this visual and understanding how the information is interrelated we can then figure out where to focus our energy for the ideation state and what pain we are hoping our product relieves.,"Mind map.Mind map has a similar function to the Concept map, but mind map doesnâ€™t have verbs and arrows to connect each concept. So we think  Concept map could help us get stronger interaction among factors.ReframingWe considered to choose reframing initially because it sounds interesting and can let us motivate different ideas. However, comparing to other methods like empathy map and concept map, it is a little bit abstract since we are still at the beginning of designing product.",10
7/20/17 23:06,Team 2,Empathy Map,"Empathy map is a efficient method to organize observations and representing our user. Our team think we should focus on our customers, combine four quadrants (sayï_Œ doï_Œ thinkï_Œ feel) together.We consider four methods as follows.Doctors said: 1.The  idea of this technology is great; 2. different doctors have different diagnosis and treatment measures, nobody can ensure which measure would lead to better results;; 3. When we take suggestions from other doctors, if his condition becomes deteriorated, who will take the responsibility;4.how to guaranteeing the sharpness of video when the doctors are keeping moving ","Do: 1. My medical apartments have CCTV to record the whole operation procedure, and have experienced doctors guide me by my side; 2. Iâ€™d love to talk more about this idea; 3.I would participate if the product was well designed.Think: 1. I think we should deal with picture clarity problem. 2. I think we should take responsibility into consideration.Feel: 1. Positiveï__ Interesting,help more inexperienced doctor get more guidance, curious 2. Negative: clarity, hard to realize.Gains:1. Build a collective knowledge base cross reference; 2.treat patients with confidence. 3.good PR for the medical industry.Pains: 1. Not sure if the diagnosis is 100% accurate; 2. Cannot consult other doctorsâ€™ opinions; 3.for beginning doctors, they especially need this validation of their diagnosis; 4.no rich record of the diagnosing process other than text information.",Mind Map,Mind map is a quick way to generate and organize infromation from our users and we can classify different opinions from patients and doctors to make them visualize and connect to each other.,It's really hard to start from the first/early stage. We need to find all sorts of information from all dimensions. What the doctors and patients said may vary greatly. So it's really important to use a method to sort out all kinds of data and find a cue to combine all of these and tag them to help visualize.,2x2 Matrix,"Since there are lots of products in the market with the same or alike functions, we should find out their market positions, so we can precisely identify the opportunity space for ours. We think it's the best way to determine the general direction for our project.","2x2 Matrix can provide a clear view of the current market condition and the trend of its development. By using this method, we can know what kind of product will best fit the market. We can find out the gap in the current medical market and capture the need of doctors and patients.",,8
7/20/17 23:39,Team 3,Concept Map,"Our team decided on using the concept map method through examining all of the methods each individual member had selected and discussing the pros and cons of each method. There was no formal selection procedure (i.e. voting) but rather we all generally agreed that this would be an excellent framework from which to conduct the analysis portion. The decision was unanimous as together we discovered the majority of us had selected this method or considered selecting this method in the individual survey so we felt it only natural for it to be featured in the main analysis phase. Overall, the selection was rather harmonious, indicating that this will be a good method for our team to invest our time in. "," The two primary reasons that our team decided to select the concept map framework was because of its adaptability and its explanatory power in the context of relationships. From our research, we concluded that our potential users had extremely divergent needs when it came to transitioning from Berkeley. The concept map framework allows for many different nodes to be displayed and examined at once, and is therefore perfect for the nature of the data that our team collected. Additionally, given the limited timeframe, we determined that the flexible nature of the concept map would allow us to utilize other methods( atomize, etc) in the context of the concept map in places that we felt needed further investigation. The advantage of the concept map is it is easily scalable, so we would be able to have a central guide that we are able to continuously refer back to during the analysis and serve as an organizer for all our other methods. In this way, the concept map become the center of our analysis process from which all other flows are derived. ",Task Analysis,"After evaluating all the options and pictured all the methods in the context of our research, we narrowed down to a handful of options that would fit in the time frame and be feasible with our target customer -- students. Rose proposed that a task analysis would be reasonable because during our previous phase, weâ€™ve identified so many key jobs that students carry on a daily basis and a task analysis would help us organize the data about students fairly well and break some of the key tasks down for us to get insights. Everyone nodded and showed that he/she agrees. We then discussed the possibility of ways that we use this method and the more we talk about it, the more feasible it appeared to us so we were sure by the end of this part of decision making. ","We decided on this method primarily because of the complicated nature of a studentâ€™s life and the need to tackle a specific problem. Since our primary customer group that we identified is international students, there are so much more aspects and daily jobs they carry than other student groups; however, at the same time, their jobs also include most of the other studentsâ€™ jobs. Because students tackle different problems and assignments on a daily basis and generally have some vague big goals in mind, it is even more important for us as â€œdesignersâ€ù to relieve their pains and create their gains to break down what they do everyday and their overarching goals to find out what is actually creating stress and bumps in their lives. We also decided to use the hierarchical task analysis in order to prioritize their many pain points and gain points and we hope that through this method, we could decide based on the analysis on which part of their lives do we want to improve.  ",Customer Journey Mapping,"Charlie proposed this method and we all at the same time agreed that this was a good idea. We started talking about why we wanted it and therefore convinced everyone on the team that we want to add this map toward our analysis. Over the discussion, we talked about that we needed more visual + analysis type of method and customer journey map seemed fun and pretty to all of us. We raised concern that a studentâ€™s daily life or a task often consists of a lot of trivial details that could be hard to keep track and all displayed on one map; however, eventually we decided that this is exactly why we would like to map the â€œjourneyâ€ù out in details to remind us of the details we often neglect but that may be important to how we feel everyday. Therefore, after a little bump in the decision making process, we reached unanimous agreement on this analysis method.",.Factors that were considered for this approach were collaboration with stakeholders. With this method we are able to directly interact with the daily routine of our users. They can begin to draw out and even mention their anecdotal experience. It allows for visual communication and info gathering otherwise not attainable through methods of interview or other static data gathering. Also allows us to understand the emotional viewpoint of our stakeholders what drives them. Factors that affect the effectiveness of this method include not being a very detailed way of info gathering and its also not linear so the documentor or visualizer may have a hard time transferring into image the overall view. The design team also needs to be able to empathize and maybe understand the emotional perspective of the user so to effectively tell the story from the side of the user.. However since we are interviewing people and using methods such as AEIOU it will be helpful to have visual clues that offer the opportunity to capture quickly without expert knowledge and to break down their experience as holistic events.,"Yes, we did consider other methods including Why-How Laddering and Kano Analysis. Also, as a matter of fact, we decided to incorporate and keep those methods in mind while we are conducting our analysis with the three primary methods that we chose for this phase of designing. For Why-How laddering, we decided that it is an extremely useful method to break down interview transcript. We decided that we can do it along the way of reading our transcripts again, and therefore decided that it was not as time consuming as the primary ones. It also already happened a little bit in our heads during our interviews and when we jot down the data. We decided that the other three primary analysis methods could yield more new insights to the problems that we have already started to brainstorm during the interview and a basic version of laddering in our heads. As for Kano Analysis, our team decided that it is a bit early for this analysis as we have not yet had a product / specific features in place to support the analysis at this stage. However, as previously mentioned, we would love the addition of a Kano Analysis to help us correctly and more reasonably position the product once our idea is mature enough. ",10
7/20/17 21:22,Team 4,Reframing,"After having finished the research, we tried to find the methods that best made sense to us and also would best complement the type of data we had acquired. We knew that campus safety was a very saturated topic and wanted to ensure we found new and unique ways to approach the issue and thus chose reframing to try to find fresh solutions.","Our research focused on a fairly specific issue of safety during transit around campus. Since this topic has been approached many times with fairly similar solution and also already includes many university-offered solutions, reframing the question would perhaps help to broaden our view and find different answers that may be more relatable to the design challenge of mobile sensing.",Atomize,"Again, in trying to find design methods that complemented our research, we came across atomization. While everyone had a very general idea of what was generally associated with campus transit and safety, atomization allows us to perhaps discover details we were not aware of that may provide a solution or a new facet of safety.","Atomization seems like a natural extension of the combination of knowledge found through AEIOU research and 1:1 interviews. By reducing the larger topic to its most basic constituents, we are able to get an extract to build larger ideas off of. It fits well since it allows us to frame all our findings and have a visual discussion over the next step  in our system.",2x2 Matrix,"While we initially did not select this method, our exploration with it in todayâ€™s class revealed that the 2x2 matrix was more important that we initially thought as it revealed certain trends through axes that we did not already consider.","As previously mentioned, during class, our use of the 2x2 matrix with safety and convenience along one axis and student/caretaker along the other helped to reveal valuable insight. By continuing use of this method with other interesting factors, we hope to find useful trends as well as opportunity to design.","*Not another method, but this is an updated re-submission as we decided to remove ""How Might We?"" for the 2 x 2 Matrix!",10
7/20/17 16:21,Team 5,Why-how Laddering,One team member suggested this method and others readily agreed.,We think this method would be a great way to flesh out customer needs from different areas ranging from practical to emotional and social.,Customer Journey Mapping,We are highly focusing on BART usersâ€™ riding experience. We all agree on this method to go deeper understanding of users.,"User experience data is clearly organized by diagram in Customer Journey Mapping, and the relations between each element is easy to read.",Kano Analysis,One of our team member points out that we need a method to categorize so many features that we came out of our product. All members agree.,"It lets us prioritize and categorize all the different features weâ€™re thinking about. In addition, we will build up a better understanding of the factors which influence customers enjoyable level of riding BART.","We had a dilemma between Concept Mapping and Customer Journey Mapping. The reason why we didnâ€™t choose Concept Mapping is that it has some limitations. For example, it canâ€™t provide detail information about usersâ€™ BART riding experience which is vital to our project. Concept Mapping delves into a topic on the surface level. ",9
7/20/17 11:43,Team 6,Empathy Map,"We took a vote on the three methods to use and empathy map had a large number of votes. From there, we discussed our options until we reached a consensus to use this method.","We chose this method so that we could understand our customer better. This method also complements the why-how laddering because that goes very deep into their needs and identifies the base need while this works at a slightly higher level and allows us to empathize with the customer. By doing so, we can better create a product that suits their needs. This is an appropriate method for tackling the challenge because it forces us into the minds of the user instead of the designer and gives us a holistic view which is very useful for creating an effective design",2x2 Matrix,We took a vote on which 3 methods to use and this gained enough votes to go onto the discussion. We discussed our options and and reached a consensus to use this method.,"Our other two methods focused on better understanding the consumer. This method complements them by allowing us to narrow down the needs into what we can implement well. This is an appropriate method because given our time constraint, we cannot work on everything at once and we must prioritize. The 2x2 matrix helps to do that.",Why-how Laddering,We took a vote on the three methods and this was one of the methods that we chose unanimously.,"We believe that by using this method, we can understand the root needs of people. By knowing what our customer wants deep down, we can better create a product that fits them. We think it is an appropriate method because it works with the amount of data that we have and it helps us understand the customer very well which is an important aspect of design.",,9
