However, I have identified more interesting methods for the reality / moment of the business / problem of which I am a part.",No,Yes,"I chose this method because it is something ""Cartesian"" and easy to apply to software with clear attributes and logical outputs. I understood this facilitator as more appropriate for a lean team and an existing software, and that demands modifications.",No,No,I did not choose this method because I understood that there are other priorities to be applied in a specific reality to which I am a part.,No,No,I did not choose this method because it is very abstract and difficult to relate business to nature. Prioritize other methods!,No,No,I did not choose this method because it is better applicable to situations where there are already clear alternatives listed. This does not exactly apply to my reality / need.,No,No,I did not choose this method because it requires a high degree of abstraction.,No,No,I did not choose this method because of the complexity of applying it to a problem. I have prioritized more practical methods.,No,No,I loved this method - I did not know it! I ended up leaving it out by having to limit the choice to 3 - and I understood that there are 3 other more assertive methods for the moment / problem I am currently working on in my business. But it is certainly a very good idealization!,No,No,"I did not know the method, and I found it interesting. I chose ""Dot Voting"" because I thought it was more dynamic.",No,No,Prioritized more practical and applicable methods to software tools - existing product and needing improvements / evaluations.,MORE TWO: 1) DOT VOTING; 2) AGILE UX SKETCHING AND SCRUM,"Both methods are related: one deals with prioritization of activities - relevance.

While I am more confident about sketching skills, I think for the group, people's lack of confidence in sketching may reduce the method's effectiveness and also make it more difficult to interpret the sketches.",No,No,"This method initially seemed appealing but also seems to have significant overlap with brain writing, which is a method I did choose. I think brain writing is just  a bit more versatile as it allows you to write and sketch to exchange ideas. Visual representation, while nice, may not always be the most efficient means to develop ideas.",No,No,"Brainstorming requires a fairly equally participating group in order to be most effective. I think that is not necessarily the case for our group so to try to maximize participation from less active members, brainstorming is probably less effective.",No,No,"Again, since this is a variation of brainstorming I don't think it would best fit our current group dynamics. The proposition of rapid idea generation does seem appealing though.",No,Yes,"I mainly chose this since regular brain writing seems to be missing. Brainwriting, however, i feel would be a valuable method for our group as it tries to draw out responses from all the members of the group which will hopefully even out participation. Furthermore, it provides a fairly free-form, open foundation that is conducive to interesting and creative ideas. I am not entirely sure 6-3-5 brain writing specifically is the best form of brain writing, as it requires 6 people and its difficult to involve everyone in the process, so the time constraints may actually work against smaller groups in creating reduced ideation volume.

Furthermore, it requires an initial prototype to use, which we do not have at this point.",Yes,No,"This is actually a method that I am interested in using. However, since it is a bit less reliable I did not directly select it. However, it would be interesting to see whether protection mechanisms in nature are applicable to human interactions.",No,Yes,I think this method would be quite effective in further developing our design once we come up with some initial solution. It is more specific than borda count voting and may help identify and prioritize our more valuable features all in a collaborative environment. ,No,No,"This method, while interesting, and perhaps performs a task kind of like reframing, I feel may not be relevant in every case. At times, it may be difficult to draw these analogies, and is heavily based on the skills of the individual participants. Furthermore, this method seems to take a significant amount of time which may not be the most efficient given the course's short time spans.",No,No,"While I am not particularly familiar with this method, it seems to be an extremely guided method without as much freedom as the other methods. Furthermore, the method supposedly generates fairly practical solutions, but our issue already generally yields practical solutions, so I think some creative solutions wouldn't hurt.",No,No,"This method may be helpful regarding more dichotomous issues, but when regarding the topic of safety, I think finding a solution for students to be unsafe may not be particularly helpful. ",No,No,"I feel as if this method is very similar to weighted matrix except it deals with an entire product rather than just features. Since we are not that far in to have many solutions yet, I think identifying and compiling features may be better.",No,Yes,"I chose this mainly because it was a somewhat different, more fun method that dealt with more visual considerations. In creating tangible selling points for our product, I think we can better understand our goals for the solution.","Nothing additional perse, but, again, I would be quite interested in looking into biomimicry.

",No,No,"I like the way it works and can't help to say that it's a good method. But I have to say, I don't like the method that will be an accident by others. For example, somebody doesn't focus on discussion, prepare for presentation and etc. I means I don't like the way which may be influenced by others.",No,No,Stress from time constraints may affect quality of ideas. We better need both quality and quantity. ,No,No,"I didn't choose it because of its limitation. If a method will inhibit creative thinking, it's just not a good method to me.",Yes,No,I just think that it's not a good way for digging deep.  It's just a way that people can pop up some ideas and modify them only.,No,No,"The core of this method I think is imagination. Because of its imagination, maybe it can generate something very creative. However, it's just make idea but not solution.

7/25/17 12:49,tyfeng@berkeley.edu,Feng,Ty,No,No,"6-Up Sketches is used to generate quick ideas in the early stage of ideation by creating rough thumbnail sketches, and it can be a good visualization tool to better communicate ideas. In order for ideas to form, however, our team needs a more structured method to generate ideas. 6-Up sketches can be too loose and it does not provide the structure or guideline that would be helpful in generating ideas. ",No,No,"Visual Brainstorming is a great method because it encourages everyone to be involved in the ideation process, instead of only one or two people talking. However, it can be possible that it is time-consuming and may not yield results that we want, in which case we would have to use other brainstorming methods. Since we donäó»t have a lot of time for our project, we need to generate ideas quickly. While visual brainstorming is good for getting everyone involved, the preparation work and the process itself can be a time sink.",Yes,No,"We would use traditional brainstorming if 3-12-3 brainstorming does not work out for us; however, we would not use traditional brainstorming first because we need to encourage more involvement and contribution from one or two team members. Our team can easily make the mistake of judging each otheräó»s ideas too harshly in traditional brainstorms, and consequently less people will contribute. ",No,Yes,"3-12-3 Brainstorming benefits us the most because we found our brainstorming sessions to be 2 hours long. Although we have captured some good ideas, to move forward we need to generate ideas more quickly and efficiently. 3-12-3 brainstorming sets up the constraints and structure that we need to capture good ideas quickly, while not overthink too much. ",No,Yes,"6-3-5 Brainwriting would work great for us because some of our team members are more quiet. While brainstorming can be intimidating as it requires verbal communication of ideas, 635 brainwriting allows equal participation. It also sets up time constraints so that our team meetings do not need to last over two hours anymore. As we donäó»t have a lot of time on our project, we need a method that can efficiently generate good ideas in limited time. ",No,No,"Attribute Listing can be a good way to break down objects into its components so that we may better analyze the object. While some of our team members may find it useful, I believe this method would make us easily fall into focusing on fire prevention as a functional problem, instead of designing for human. ",Yes,No,"Do-Redo-Undo works great when debugging potential problems in a prototype, and it minimizes problems users may face.  As of right now, we do not have a prototype yet, and our potential prototype is not likely to require a lot of interaction between users and the system. ",Yes,No,"Biomimicry is finding solutions or inspiration from mother nature to solve complex mechanical or engineering problems. In the case of our project, we need to solve a lot of emotional problems instead of mechanical or engineering problems. Therefore, biomimicry would be less effective and helpful for our project. ",Yes,No,"Weighted Matrix is a good method for quick and unbiased decision making. For it to be truly useful, however, we need to have a clear criteria and factors that we need to evaluate. As of right now, we do not have clearly defined criteria or factors. It is also a bit too rigid for us to generate creative ideas. ",No,No,"Forced Analogy can help us break our current thinking pattern and see problems in a different way. However, it would not work great for us because it can too loose and unstructured. The eventual ideas that it generates may not be practical or useful. For us to think analogically, design heuristics would work better for us. ",No,No,"Design Heuristics incorporates analogical thinking into a structured guideline of 77 cards.

However, it focuses on making decisions based on existing ideas instead of continuing making new ones. Thus, this method can restrain us from generating new or better ideas. ",Yes,No,"Although Design the Box method can solidify the intangible ideas into a physical item, it can make us easily fall into focusing on salesmanship instead of the core idea or product value itself.

7/25/17 11:35,rosemin@berkeley.edu,Min,Rose,No,Yes,"I chose this method because it is fast in jotting down ideas. Since we do not have a product in mind yet, I would like to see the features that come in our mind quickly jotted down on the pages so we can build up the communication and discuss the features we want for our solution. It is also fun and easier to be able to visualize my teammate's ideas about our solution. It is easy, and therefore we can start ideating with this methods and then go deeper and more focused with other methods. ",No,No,"The methods involves pre-existing ideas that we as a group have already decided on and also requires planning and organizing our ideas in a way that we can bring it out to physical / visual pieces that we can play around with. In our particular context, I believe it is too time-consuming and requires too much preparation and group time together. As students, our schedules are too unpredictable to decide on a long meeting time to complete a task like visual brainstorming. Although I recognize that it could be fun and effective for team bonding and individual contribution and creativity in the entire group, it is a pity that we do not have enough time to carry this method out. ",Yes,Yes,"I believe the brainstorming session could be a smooth transition after our 6-up sketches. After our individual 6-up sketches, each of the team member in our team should have different individual ideas about features that we would like to see. Brainstorming is a effective method to bring these ideas together for the entire team to evaluate, criticize, and improve. Seeing other teammates ideas may also trigger some new creative ideas. I believe brainstorming is not only good for our team dynamic, but also encourages the two quiet teammates to contribute to the team because I know they have ideas and they may just need a push like this to speak up. ",No,No,"I really like the structure and the time restraint on this method, as it requires quick thinking and prevents overthinking. However, based on our team profile, we all think at different pastes and some of our teammates may be stressed out that the could not think of things as quickly as the others and get discouraged. I admire this method but I do not think it is the best for our team. And also we may want to overthink a little in order to create a unique and effective solution, and I do not think the team would mind spending a little extra time on ideating even under the strict time constraint of this project. ",No,No,"This method seems extremely effective in getting ideas out of the quieter members of the team, but since I have already selected the 6-up sketches, I believe the sketches shall generate about the same amount of ideas as from this method, if not more well-thought over ones. The strict time restraint on this method requires on-the-spot thinking, and as well as I know my team, this may not yield the most ideal result. I believe a long individual ideating process followed by a rather fast paste group ideation may be better. ",No,No,"As the limitation on tDX states, we have not yet have an existing product and therefore it is going to be hard for us to quickly narrow down the features and attributes and be sure to evaluate those in the ideation process. I see that this method can be very useful in innovating new feature for an existing product and therefore shall be useful potentially in a later phase of the project. In short, it might be too early for us to implement this method because we may be stuck when we try to list down the attributes.   ",No,No,"We have not yet have a prototype or a concrete idea for our solution and therefore according to tDX, now is not the best time to utilize this method. I see that this method is relatively easy to prepare for and does not take too long to carry out. So in later stage of our ideation when we already have a concept, our team shall consider implementing this method in order to improve and evaluate the current idea. ",No,No,"For our topic, target audience, and its pain points, I don't believe that asking nature can yield effective and concrete solution. A large part of our problem is actually caused by nature because it is our natural fear to fear the unknown and the unfamiliar, and we are trying to bridge the gap for the international students who is trying to fight this natural instinct. I can see that biomimicry can be useful in other design situations, but I do not see it in our design context. ",No,Yes,"From the research and analysis phase, there has already been signs that there will be a lot of features that we may come up with in this phase. I believe the weighted matrix is an effective method for us as a team to decide on our priority and a more focused feature in order to build our solution around that. Being able to discuss as a group and give numbers and weights to each feature we come up with would be really useful in our design project because there are so many pain points that we would like to address. ",No,No,"This method seems very time-consuming and given our fast paste designing environment in this course, this may not be the perfect option to yield effective solution in our time period. I really enjoy learning about this ideating method, however. I like it because it is rather mind-opening to see that we can force compare two things that do not seem to have any similarity and potentially generate useful insights about product features. I believe this could be particularly useful in other product design process where designers, researchers, and engineers are allowed longer periods of time to ideate. ",No,No,"The method seems to be more effective when individually carried out, and I feel that our team needs some team collaboration after the 6-up sketches. We may spend too much time on ideating individually and it would be very time-consuming to bring all the individual ideas together and reach a team consensus. Although not chosen, I still believe that we can use this heuristic way of thinking in our 6-up sketches and yield even better sketches that way. ",No,No,"This method is extremely time-consuming and I am afraid that we will not be able to carry it out within the time frame that we got. It also require a bare minimum of 5 players, and our number of member is on the low extreme of this requirement, so I do not see this as the most effective method in our team project. It is a method that we would not normally think of, so it is very interesting to learn about. Now that we have this knowledge in mind, I hope that our team will stay open to the potential usage of this method. ",No,No,"This method is similar to the weighted matrix in that they are both trying to give priority to features. I chose the matrix over voting because deciding the weight for the matrix as a team is already a subtle vote among the team mates, and it is more efficient in our context to use matrix instead of the time-consuming voting and calculation in the borda count. ",No,No,"As well as I know my team, I believe we will focus too much on the aesthetic and the position of this potential product and therefore the method loses its point of helping us getting the ideas straight. I believe designing the box can be extremely useful to decide on our top features for the potential solution, but the weighted matrix will also do that in ways that our team in particular will focus on the ideas.",,,10,
7/25/17 0:19,mcreese@berkeley.edu,Reese,Michael,No,Yes,"I really like the idea of 6-Up sketches as a way to catalyze the ideation process. The 6-Up process is particularly useful in the context of our product as it offers a way to visually represent a product in the midst of a larger process. I feel since our team has a firm grasp of the process that our users are undergoing through our research in the first two modules, 6-up sketching would be a great tool to naturally extend our understanding through taking a big picture look at the product in the formal ecosystem. Additionally, I think 6-up works well given the limited time we have to complete our project. I like how open the method is, and it would allow us to explore different paths to ideation. However, it is important to keep in mind the time constraints and keep 6-up sketching on track. Despite this, I think 6-upp sketching would fit well into the groupäó»s process and help us kickstart the ideation process",No,No,"While I think visual brainstorming is a great tool, our group has done a significant amount of visual brainstorming already, and have the opportunity to do so in the future. I think visual brainstorming is more of a supplementary method to complement other processes, hence why I declined to select this method.",Yes,No,"Like with visual brainstorming, brainstorming is more of a support process that aids in the execution of other processes( in my opinion). Brainstorming can be done in conjunction with other methods. In this respect, I decided not to include it as it can be conducted as needed under specific circumstances. ",No,No,"While 3-12-3 brainstorming is more structured making it a largely independent method, the issues with it does not necessarily generate good ideas as a result of its structure. Therefore, I feel like 3-12-3 brainstorming is more suited, again, as a predecessor to other longer methods which is not the most efficient use of time. ",No,Yes,"I think the 6-3-5 brainwriting method would be a great way to build on the 6-up sketches by rapidly transforming our insights and understanding of the process into viable ideas. In particular, the ability to just start ideating is particularly appealing as I believe that our group would function well under time constraints, which would help to generate ideas. Additionally, I think 6-3-5 brainwriting fits well with our group dynamic, as some of our members have great ideas but do not speak up often. Thus, 6-3-5 brainwriting is the perfect way to involve everyone while accomplishing the task at hand.",No,No,"I think attribute analysis is more suited for a physical product, and considering that our product will most likely be digital, I believe it would be more prudent to select another method.",No,No,"While I think Do-redo-undo is a great method, but I think it will be difficult to conduct without a solid idea of what form the product will take. Therefore, I think it's a little early for our group to utilize do-redo-undo to its full extent.",No,No,"Biomimicry is really interesting, but I feel as though it is more suited to physical products. Considering this, I do not think it is appropriate for our group who will most likely be approaching the problem from a digital perspective.",No,No,"Weighted Matrix certainly seems useful, but still a bit premature in our team's ideation process. While the analysis portion has yielded good insight into what features are desirable, our team still needs to solidify the product concept. Therefore, I feel like the weighted matrix would be more useful as a tool to refine the initial selection of features at a later date.",No,No,"The forced analogy method seems, for a lack of a better word, forced. I think our team would benefit from a more concrete method that yields more insight into the actual product we should create and the features we should include. ",No,No,"While I think that design heuristics are an invaluable tool, I believe that the process driven 6-up would be more effective considering our current vision for the product. I believe the team needs a more decision driven process to complement our other methods.",No,No,"While I think that the anti-problem method can be useful under certain circumstances, I think it is to early to make a decision regarding whether or not it is required for our group. Therefore, I believe it is not necessary to choose at this time.",No,No,"Borda Count voting seems more like a decision making processes to complement ideation. However, I think at this point in time it is not a particularly useful framework for organizing our team, as we usually already vote to decide decisions. Therefore, I feel like borda counting is a bit superfluous. ",No,Yes,"I think design the box would be a great method to employ, particularly because our group needs to better consider the appeal of our product and how to market it to a larger audience and quantify the intangible points for our product. This method is excellent because it acts to condense the groupäó»s ideation problem and think about what is tangible and realistically accomplished within the limited timeframe. In this way, design the box will be useful to reel in the ideation process and drive us towards creating realistic solutions that are viable in the collegiate ecosystem.  ",,,10,

7/24/17 23:26,Charliewangzixuan@gmail.com,WANG,ZIXUAN,Yes,Yes,"6-Up Sketches are used to generate quick ideas, in the form of rough thumbnail sketches. These generally depict different aspects of a user experience, for any product or website. Visual representation can help you take a step back and look at the big picture of the customer experience. This method allows for basic analysis of your existing or potential product. 6-Up Sketches are very useful for brainstorming and quick idea generation. Whatever comes to your mind, draw it out and we are good at drawing. Participants engaging in 6-Up Sketching are able to see that generating many ideas is a key to generating good ideas. They are able to realize that their early ideas are not always best",Yes,No,"A Visual Brainstorm is a brainstorm variation where ideas are drawn instead of listed verbally. Participants may use boxes, arrows, callouts, metaphors, or sketches.  But it requires some preparation and can be a time sink or can cause competition. Whatäó»s more, it could be a distraction to the groupäó»s focus",Yes,No,"Brainwriting is similar to brainstorming, but rather than sharing ideas verbally, participants are asked to write their ideas silently, often by passing paper between them. The goal is to help reduce the dominance of the group by more vocal members and better draw on the creativity of all participants through silent, one-to-one communication. There are several variations. But this method is difficult when developing ideas for complex problems, as participants do not have an opportunity to verbally clarify and discuss specifics during the brainwriting session",Yes,Yes,Brainstorming is a group or individual ideation method by which efforts are made to find a solution for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously generated by participants. It will be easy to unstructured and flexible technique and allows the entire design team to participate. so the term is often used as a catchall for ideation.,Yes,No,"Based on brainstorming, brainwriting is designed to develop 108 ideas in half an hour. 6 participants are gathered and charged with coming up with 3 ideas in 5 minutes before handing off their ideas to the next person. The next participant reads the ideas and uses them as inspiration for a further 3. This process is repeated five times, resulting in 108 ideas in 30 minutes. Quality of answers depends on wording of question. But stress from time constraints may affect quality of ideas. Is same with brainstorming.",Yes,No,"Attribute listing breaks an existing product or system down into its component parts to explore different ways of modifying or replacing each part for the same or better effect. By listing attributes, it is possible to gain general and specific views of the äóìworldäóù of that subject.  Improvement of each component may conflict with the cohesiveness of the overall product, so compromises must be made. And designers should be aware of combinations that might not be feasible.",Yes,No,This method is not good for a group to talk with other,Yes,No,"Biomimicry allows designers to solve complex problems using inspiration from the natural world. Organisms have withstood the test of time and have perfected their processes through natural selection. This method allows designers to utilize that knowledge. Solutions can be complicated, because biological systems are complicated",Yes,Yes,"In a weighted matrix, design options are listed as columns and the design factors/criteria are listed as rows. Each criterion is assigned a weight to show its relative importance. Each design option is numerically scored for each criterion and this score is multiplied by the criterionäó»s weight. Weighted scores are summed, giving a total score for each design option.Useful when there any several alternatives and several varying criteria of importance being considered. ",Yes,No,"In Forced Analogy, participants generate a random list of things-animals, objects, or people and write them on index cards. For each item, participants write the qualities or attributes. Then shuffle the cards and distribute them randomly. They then use the cards to develop analogies to the problem or issue at hand, asking: How is this problem similar to [random object]? How would I solve this problem with [random object]? This method can be fun for groups",Yes,Yes,"Designers using the Design Heuristic cards should not assume that the solutions they develop using the cards are necessarily the best solutions to the design task. As with all ideation techniques, the ideas generated using Design Heuristics will require further iteration and development as they progress through the design process.",Yes,Yes,"The method is efficient when a team starts running out of ideas for solutions when they are working on a problem. Team members identify ways to solve the problem opposite to their current problem, and in turn determine where a current solution might be going astray. This allows the team to consider what a successful solution should be like.Helps a team to solve a problem or to generate ideas when the team is stuck on finding solutions. ",Yes,No,"In Borda Count Voting, voters rank options in order of preference. Each option is given the number of points corresponding to the position in which it was ranked by each voter. Each optionsäó» points are then added together to give a total score. Takes time for each idea or viewpoint to be discussed before the voting session Can be difficult if voters are not open-minded to new thoughts or ideas Decisions may be affected by the size of the presence of majority or minority opinions",Yes,No,"In this method, you and your team attempt to sell your idea by creating the packaging, or the box, that the product would be sold in. It doesnäó»t matter if the idea will ultimately become a tangible item or not. The exercise forces the team to focus on the important features and the purpose of the idea.",,,8, You clearly are doing the work to understand the design methods - try to focus more on reasoning for why you choose some over others in the context of the design challenge and your team. You don't have to provide a summary of each method - the reasoning and comparison of methods is more important for these surveys.

What's more, 6 photots can not contain all the imformation we want.",Yes,No,"This method could be very useful when we only thought of ideas but have no solutions to solve it, and use legos to communicate ideas. We might not have legos to help us to complete this model, and we focus more on product's function than its physical.",Yes,Yes,"This method is the most basic method to find a solution. Our team can put forward our thoughts and combine them together. By this way, everyone in our team can fully participate and we can receive a list of ideas.",No,No,"This method is excellent that we can not only brainstorming but also generating ideas and presentating to others. However, in my opinion, the time is so limited that we might not fully consider the factors. ",No,No,"This method is designed to develop 108 ideas in half an hour, but in reason of we don't know what others' idea is, lots of idea are same. In this case, we still need delete ideas and categorize them, which is not effective.",Yes,Yes,"This method may not including all features about a product. But it breaks a complex task down into more manageable parts, we can clearly figure out and improve our product.",Yes,Yes,"We already have a prototype or concept abuot our concept, but after interviewing and analysising, we discovered a lot of mistakes. In this case, we should use this method to fix mistakes.",Yes,No,"I'm not so familiar with biological system. In this case, lack of acknowledgement, I may  not always be solutions using this method.",Yes,No,"This method needs us to use some criterion to weight scores. However, different people would have different opinions, I wonder how could this method remove bias by individually assessing each option?",No,No,"This method requires us to thinking creatively and solve the problem. However, it takes time to prepare and conduct a forced analogy session.",No,No,"It seems that this method is useful for novice and expert designers, which provide a wide variety of potential solution. In fact, after watching video about 77 cards, I still not truly understanding this method. Wating for professor's explanation.",No,No,"This method requires the team breaks into small groups and comes up with solution to the opposite of the problem they're working on. However, the number of our team is 4, lower than 5 persons.",No,No,"In this method, points are assigned to candidates based on their ranking, in this case, the team can decide which idea to pursue during the ideation phase more easily. However, it seems our team could active listening to others and makeing a vote easy. In this case, I didn't choose this method.",No,No,"This method is so interesting! It forces teams to clarify much of the intangible information into selling points. This method focus on salesmanship rather than the product itself, which is not suit to our project.",NA,NA,8,
