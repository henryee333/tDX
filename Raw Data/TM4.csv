8/3/2017 23:42:43,Team 1,Prototyping,"Since our design team is in the build stage and deciding the best way of working on a physical product that will incorporate mobile sensing, we felt that prototyping would be the most applicable to our project. ","Prototyping allows us to make our ideas tangible by creating physical representations through a multitude of techniques such as laser cutting and tangible prototyping.  It can reduce the risk of costly development, making sure whether the product work as expected. Having physical representations and models allows us to better understand our designs since our team and the users can physically interact with it.",Tangible Prototype,"Our team agreed that using tangible prototyping to create a physical model of our design concept with the critical features, would be very useful in determining how we should proceed forward. And we can easily find materials like cardboard and scrap in the classroom for this method. ","Tangible prototype is great because the method allows us to quickly test functions and features of our design ideas. Another useful property of this method is that it does not require any special or technical skills, which means that everyone in the group can contribute equally.
    This method can help a lot when developing our product. With more prototypes, we gather more information, which gives us great insight to improve our product. From this procedure, we find it really useful to figure out our shortcoming through building different prototypes, so we will continue building prototype if the conditions are permitted.",Rapid Prototyping,"Several group members suggested using this method due to its benefit of achieving multiple rounds of iteration. We quickly reached group consensus and began creating our first prototype. Since we are limited on time, this method can save a great amount of time for us.","Our team had yet to decide which our three concepts we were going to move forward with, thus we felt that using rapid prototyping, with other teams acting as our customer insight, would help us decide which concept would be most beneficial to our target customers and which features they felt would be most important. Information gathered from the first round would then be used to chose a design concept to move forward with and improve based on suggestions. We also considered the limitations we had with time and resources. Since we only had less than a week to build our product, we decided that rapid prototype is a great way for us to get through multiple iterations and improve our product.","Laser Cutting.
    Laser cutting was also considered for one of our build methods. Laser cutting is readily available on the second floor of Jacobs and would allow us to create intricate features relatively fast.",9
8/3/2017 20:09:23,Team 2,Wireframe,"A wireframe is a user interface like a screen or web page. It can visually depict the layout of an app. In our product, we create a Medicine Box which is connected to the app to remind people to take the medicine on time. There may be different screens to show which medicine you need to take and screens in various colors to inform you. So by using this method, it’s the quickest and easiest way to present our ideas as well as adding some more screens to it. Instead of spend much time on the programming, wireframe can also achieve our goals and test the functionality and show our product to the users directly and clearly.","Efficiency and visualization may be the main factors that we consider very important. By using this method, we can efficiently present our ideas directly and clearly. We won’t come across the problems that we can’t express ourselves clearly or we can’t find out how the programming works. Our aim is to show the users how does our product work and how to use it. Wireframe can help tackle the challenge by creating visual design layouts and can be added to the brainstorming process where we can develop our design by receiving more feedbacks.",Experience Prototype,"Using this method, provides us a chance to show and test our design via active user participation, we can easily get feedback and make major design changes and decisions in the early stages of product development. Through this method, we can easily and quickly get the feedback of our product, and ensures this product is focus on user-centered. To be more specific, in our project, we want to design a medicine box that remind old patients to take medicine on time. Once we have made our product, we are eager to get feedback from old patients and other groups, only in this way, can we improve the role of products.","The first factor our group considered is the feedback from users. In order to get the feedback, we can interview our users, which we had completed. In this step, is time to build our product, the best way to get feedback and improve our product is let the old patients to experience the product themselves.",Fused Deposition Models,"Our team chose this building method because we thought it is the quickest and easiest way to build prototype. 3D printing models are delicate and low-cost, so we can express our ideas better. ","Since our team is doing a medical project in a short time, the time efficiency seems especially important. By using FDM 3D printing, the prototype can be produced quickly and with high quality. Thus we will have more time to improve our prototype and add more function to it.",,9
8/3/2017 23:59:45,Team 3,Wireframe,"Wireframes visually depict the rudimentary layout of an app or website.  This method can be really suitable for our product. At the very begining, we decided to use wireframes to present and improve our app.","We chose wireframe as our build method mainly because the character like visualized, effective and sketch-like. Our design is based on Berkeley map to develop all other concept. The design solution requires both time counting system and the information from users. Wireframe provide us with a more elaborated function. ",Prototyping,"In ideate step, we brainstormed many ideas and refined to 3 main concepts. From then on, our group want to build a tangible product to present our ideas. When we saw the varied material that Mr. Kim offered to us, the prototyping could be a really fun activity and helpful in showing our applicant. Imani took some clay and cardboard, she made an impressive 3 dimension map. And other team member use some other simple material to build an artificial mobile phone.","The main factors that contributed to our decision in choosing prototyping are tangible, visualized, fun and good operability. Cause build process is a qualitative leap. Our product are not in draft anymore. First of all, we want this process is easy to operate, prototypes are low resolution artifacts and can be anything that a user can interact with. We just use some simple material like clay, cardboards,papers to finish our product. Second, our product is a simple applicant with three main concept. We want to make it tangible to present all this features accurately. Third, we want all team members could get involved and have fun. In this build process, we confront some problems like surface designing and convergence between pages. But with team communication and improvement, we fix all these. This method can help us improve our product.",Service Prototype,Allowing users to go through the service allowed us to understand what problems might arries from the service and errors created even from our solutions. ,"The factors that contributed to our decision was that our app required peope to interactive with existing businesses and processes so it was a a great opportunity to see if your idea was useful in these circumstances one being the meeting and scheduling of an advising appointment. Finding a good place to eat that is also a short wait and last was finding a good place to network with people you like.

We are not at the stage to do that but may use this in our final presentation.,9
8/3/2017 21:53:59,Team 4,Wireframe,"Wireframe is the build method given that most directly addresses application building, so we knew it would be a crucial method for our project.
","Our design solution requires  both  a smart street light/waypoint system along with a way to access them as well as relay the information collected back to the user, so wireframe offered the ideal method to quickly come up with the screens the app should offer and how the app would function. It provides a great starting point to continue building off of for higher fidelity prototypes.
",Tangible Prototype,"While building a full scale street lamp seems a bit of a tall order, we definitely want to create something tangible that combines the app and perhaps a scale model of the waypoints.
","The vision for our design solution is very grounded in a physical product complimented by a digital interface. So in order to represent that well, we feel that there is definitely a need for some physical model of the waypoints that relates to the app we create. We want to ensure that the app is not the primary focus as the solution actually aims to reduce phone usage while walking.
",Rapid Prototyping,"This method goes hand in hand with our necessity of a physical complement to our application portion. We’ve largely focused on the app prior, so rapid prototyping would be a good way to quickly create higher fidelity physical prototypes.
","Given the length of the class, some of the more uncommon rapid fabrication techniques may not be ideal or familiar. We left it a bit more open at rapid prototyping, but 3D printing or laser cutting may be likely choices. These methods would allow us to easily create model waypoints from 3D models and thus allow us to quickly create medium fidelity prototypes as well as possibly iterate on those prototypes.

8/3/2017 23:49:02,Team 5,Wireframe,"We agreed on this method the quickest because our product relies on a mobile interface to communicate information.
","We needed a way to visualize the mobile design of our product. This method allows us to prioritize content and categorize/structure our product’s services into menu items. We will be able to get a better understanding of how we want our application to work. This method is also desirable because it is a low-fidelity means of prototyping and we only have a short amount of time to implement it.
",Prototyping,"Undoubtedly, we need this method to make ours abstract ideas real.
As a result, we all agree this method!
","We needed a way to validate and demonstrate the mobile design of product. Prototyping provide an effective and simple way to transform our abstract ideas into concrete example in order to help anchor a discussion about the design, which is very important to our product.This method is also a bridge helping us to communicate and convince a client of the feasibility of a project.
 
",Experience Prototype,"The development of the product is currently one that’s low-fidelity, i.e. the consumers may not stick to or even begin using the product without proper instruction or assistance. My team and I would provide the necessary help to the consumers when they try out the prototype for the first time. 

","The App that we’re designing has various features and functions. As a result, with experiential prototyping, we may be able to test out different versions of the prototype. For example, we could omit several features in one version while keeping the omitted features in the other versions, in an attempt to find out the consumer preference of the features.
","Because the methods above all are necessary for our product. Other methods can't provide those needs to our product, for example, storyboarding, Laminated Object Manufacturing.",9
8/4/2017 0:13:47,Team 6,Prototyping,"In our group, we used discarded items, like cardboards and plastic bottle, to prototype our scanning camera. With the model we made, we were able to understand the look and the feel of our design concepts in reality. We created a low-fidelity prototype to visualize our core ideas and to also explore new functionalities to add onto the product. Our first low-fidelity prototype was a mock-up craft materials to test the initial concept, then we could move to a higher resolution prototype using CAD. As we have seen the effectiveness and benefits of prototyping, and how much our project relies on it, we all agreed that prototyping should be one of the three design methods that we use. ","Prototyping is the iterative development of products, intended to elicit qualitative or quantitative feedback. When we’ve already had the concepts and ideas of our product, we need physical objects to present it. This method allows direct realization of design concepts, it can help us build a model to visualize our product. During the prototyping process, we can find the weakness of our product, finding the problems just like what is unrealizable, what needs high technology, and which part is not good enough. As a method that creates low to medium fidelity prototype, prototyping also nicely complements with additive manufacturing, which involves 3-D printing to produce a higher fidelity prototype. However, it would be difficult to produce quality high-fid prototypes without building low-fid prototypes first.
",Wireframe,"We firstly reviewed the methods that are available and feasible to our project. We then came to a consensus on this method since it has been proved to be effective when we were developing our mid-fidelity prototype. In between Tuesday and Thursday’s peer review, we have used wireframe to build a clickable mid-fid prototype for the app. It clearly conveyed the features and benefits of our app. It was also easy to agree on using wireframe because we needed a design method to prototype our app idea, and wireframe is specifically used for UI design. 
","We chose this method based on its effectiveness in experimenting, validating, communicating our ideas in a short amount of time with no need to code or to build high fidelity prototypes. We also happen to know and have used several effective prototyping tools, such as Adobe Experience Design, and we knew that Adobe XD could help us a lot with wireframing and prototyping. We think that we need wireframe to tackle our design challenge because it is the best way to prototype a UI. It helps us to figure out the flow of user interactions with our app, and also to figure out what features should be empathized and what should not. Since we could make the app prototype clickable, we can let users to use our app and provide feedback. 
",Additive Manufacturing,"Our group came to a consensus on this method after viewing all the options. Afterwards, we narrowed it down to the methods that were feasible to our product and could make our product resemble what we wanted. Since we already had plans for a 3D printed prototype, this was chosen as one of our methods.
","We chose this method so that we could get a medium fidelity prototype to demonstrate our product with as an upgrade to our cardboard box. By using this, we can create a part that looks exactly as we want it but in plastic, and we can iterate quickly through designs since it only takes a few hours to print.",,9
