7/31/2017 10:51:05,Team 1,6-Up Sketches,"After reviewing the different methods in lecture, we talked amongst ourselves and discussed the pros and cons of each method to choose the one that is most useful. One team member suggested that 6-Up sketches is a great method to start out with since it allows each member to draw and write up their 6 best ideas to share with the group. After reaching group consensus, we began sketching out our ideas individually. ","Since our goal during the ideate stage was to exchange ideas and generate as many design concepts as possible, we needed a method that promotes creative thinking and group discussion. We thought that 6-Up Sketches was a very good method for idea exchange since it allows each individual to introduce their top six designs with the rest of the team using sketches. We really liked the use of sketches as a way to present ideas since visuals are great for understanding a concept or product design.",6-3-5 Brainwriting,"Now that we’ve got our best ideas out in the open, it was time to generate more ideas. One member suggested using 6-3-5 Brainwriting as our next ideation method due to it yielding many concepts in a short amount of time. After considering the pros (generates many ideas, saves time, efficiency) and cons (time pressure may affect quality of ideas) of this method as a group, we reached group consensus once again and began exercising this method. ","We considered the pros and cons of this method. 6-3-5 Brainwriting allows us to develop each team member’s ideas as well as to write down new ideas inspired by them. Because each round of idea generation is only 5 minutes and there are a total of six rounds, we are able to generate many ideas using this method. One limitation that we considered was the pressure and stress from the time constraint may reduce the quality of our ideas. However, we felt that the pros outweighed the con and for this reason, we chose this method. ",Brainstorming,"Due to time restraints for generating design concepts during lecture, our team was unable to generate 60 ideas by the end of lecture. In order to come up with additional ideas, our team decided to brainstorm and add ideas to our spreadsheet. ","The reason why we chose Brainstorming is because this method is freeform and lacks any method guidelines, which allows room for exploration, flexibility and creativity. We believed that having this freedom will aid us in thinking outside of the box and generating unprecedented design concepts. This method also allows for both individual work and group collaboration by using different ways of brainstorming.","Visual Brainstorming
One of our team members suggested this method but we discovered that we did not have needed tools to carry it out. We also determined that visual brainstorming would require more time than was available during the lecture period.
Weighted Matrix
We only have concepts of our product but we haven’t figured the details and function of it. It will be difficult to use this method since we don’t have concrete idea.",10
7/30/2017 21:08:39,Team 2,Visual Brainstorming,"Visual Brainstorming helps us to get a better understanding of what’s our exact thinking is, sometimes it may be a little hard to express only by words. Also, visual pictures can give us a vivid description of our insights and it may arouse other insights if someone else sees your pictures.","Through this method, it helps us to figure out many thoughts that can’t be express clearly. And when someone shows a picture, we may have some questions towards this, then we will think of some related situations or solutions to this problem. This helps us to enlarge our project and we consider this to be a main factor for us to choose this method.",3-12-3 Brainstorming,"3-12-3 Brainstorming provides us so limited time to brainstorming and presenting the ideas we generated. Our team decide on using this method because it gives us time pressure, make use of the class time to brainstorm and generate ideas, express our ideas in the group. Though we can’t generate lots of ideas in a such a short time, we still try it!","The factors we considered is whether we could generate ideas in such a short time without any laborious discussion and whether this idea can improve our existing project and strategy. Luckily, we did! I highly recommend this method because in such a fast paced process, we could explore deeper mind to make decisions, and we can generate more ideas than just sit listless and think the ideas.",Attribute Listing,"In ideate process, we wants to get as more ideas as possible. Using the attribute listing, we can combine different functions together to form a complicated system and gain more ideas in shorter time.","In an integrated system, every parts act in their functions. We thought using Attribute Listing to separate links apart can greatly add possibility and variety to our product. Thus it helps us to come up with more creative ideas with quality.",,9
7/31/2017 0:10:06,Team 3,Brainstorming,"Our team opted to using brainstorming as one of our ideation methods due to the difficult time constraints and freedom offered by the process. We were all familiar with collective brainstorming as a process, and as a result of the completion of the 10 individual ideas, we were in a  good position to have a productive ideation/brainstorming session. We arrived at the consensus through discussion and then a vote, which was unanimously in favor of utilizing the brainstorming process. ","
 In terms of structure, our team decided to take a ‘round robin approach in which we all took turns coming up with an idea and then gave feedback. After, we each took 10-15 min to sketch down the ideas that we had brainstormed while incorporating the feedback we received from round one. We then conducted another round of feedback with all of our completed ideas. From there we each used dot voting to select what our team believed to be the most viable of the ideas and did yet another round of brainstorming as to what these concepts would look like fleshed out, thus combining design-the-box in our brainstorming portion. By having multiple rounds of this brainstorming/feedback loop, we believe that we narrowed down our ideation process to produce both quantity and quality which made the clustering process easier, thus hopefully leading to a smooth creation process. 
",Design Heuristics,"As a team, we first were experimenting with different methods when we were first asked to start ideating in class. After the guest speaker’s lectures and detailed explanations of different ideation methods, we thought that design heuristics would be a fun team activity and helpful in developing various ideas that we came up with. A little bit into the ideation stage, Rose went up and took some design heuristics cards and shared it with the team. Our team all started to pull the cards and experiment with it. Later on in the decision making process, Imani proposed that this should be one of our three ideating methods, and the team unanimously agreed that it is a fun process and help generate interesting and unique ideas. ","The main factors that contributed to our decision in choosing design heuristics are fun and fluidity of the ideation process. We want the ideation process to be fun for all the members so that we do not get discouraged by sudden writer's’ block in coming up with so many ideas. We also want the ideation process to be mostly a team effort and keep everyone in the team engaged in the idea generation, evaluation, and combination. One of the main problems we encountered individually when we were coming up with our own concepts was that we seemed to be fixated on a few features of the solutions and cannot seem to create more new ideas. After we started using the cards, we realized that design heuristics is good for both team communication, spirit, and individual writer’s blocks in the ideation process.",Weighted Matrix,"Our team chose weighted matrix as one of us ideation method due to the decision make in comparing different supplies. Weighted matrices can be used to evaluate and prioritize alternative design options during concept evaluation.We have already come up with several design opinions but the thing is we also have diverse tendency towards each opinions. Each design option is numerically scored for each criterion and this score is multiplied by the criterion’s weight by using this method.Therefore, we believe weighted matrix will provide us with accurate, scored opinion.","Overall, they reason why weighted matrix was chosen when selecting methods was its accuracy. Given a lot of option we concluded. We are supposed to quantitative analyse all opinions and rank them to have specific sequence. By using weighted matrix, weighted scores are summed, giving a total score for each designed method. This is our team’s decision-making process.",,10

7/31/2017 9:35:20,Team 4,Borda Count Voting,"While we were in class working on the process of reducing our selections, Borda vote counting was an immediate choice as we needed a way to quickly find our top 3 concepts.","As we needed to narrow down the many options we had initially come up with, we decided to use borda vote counting as one of the methods of selection. The high degree of specificity with which the system ranked, we felt was extremely valuable whereas dot voting left us with many ties. As such we used dot voting to do an initial round of selection then borda vote counting for our final round.",Brainstorming,"After finishing the initial in class exercise of individual ideation, we needed a method to combine our ideas and create new ones, and thus brainstorming was a natural solution.","We specifically chose brainstorming as a collaborative method over other methods like brainwriting as our group preferred a vocal method of sharing ideas whereas brainwriting was very silent. The nature of brainstorming being more of a collaborative, group activity allows everyone to contribute more equally and build off of each other’s ideas to create more sophisticated solutions.",The Anti-Problem,"The anti-problem was a common ideation method used throughout our group during the individual ideation exercise. While it is not the only method we used, we chose to include this in our final 3 methods as it produced some of the most interesting results.","The anti-problem interesting method utilized across the group largely for its ability to provide solutions from a perspective. It is easy to get locked into creating that only address one aspect of the issue. However, anti-problem allowed us to analyze our initial issues from strange new viewpoints that may not have seemed intuitive but actually provided very relevant solutions.
","While we listed anti-problem specifically, we utilized many different ideation methods. Particularly notable methods outside of the anti-problem include biomimicry and design heuristics as they helped to create interesting and novel ideas. Our selected results arose as a result of anti-problem and brainstorming, thus we focused more on those methods. Furthermore, we utilized dot voting as an initial selection stage to sort out the most relevant and interesting results, which we later followed up on with borda count voting.

7/31/2017 10:45:01,Team 5,Visual Brainstorming,"Note: We actually chose Dot Voting but this wasn't an option listed in the Google Form. We were encouraged to use this method in class and we unanimously agreed and dove into it without much discussion.
","Since our concepts were already up on our boards in sticky-note format, we thought this method would be nice to use since we would be able to see every concept at once (as opposed to scrolling through an excel document). We liked the visual nature of the voting and we were able to quickly glance through and compare different concepts within their clusters.
",6-3-5 Brainwriting,We had a brief group discussion in class and we all agreed this would be a good way to quickly come up with and modify ideas.,"We considered the fact that we wanted to rapid-fire generate concepts and the nature of this method forced us to do that. We slightly modified this method however in that after the 5 minutes were up, we spent about 10-15 minutes reviewing each other's ideas and adding comments or making modifications. Once we were finished doing this, we set the timer to 5 minutes and repeated the process again.
",Borda Count Voting,"Before trying to select the several methods of top, we didn’t know how to choose top methods among methods we had made. 
And then we found that Borda Count Voting was an immediately way helping us quickly find out the top ranking methods.
","There were too many methods to select top ranks and we needed to reduce the range of our methods. By equally voting, we could select our team’s top ranks in a very short time and knew everyone’s different decisions or opinions to each other. Meanwhile, we spent almost less than 15 minutes to complete the format including voting and conclusion instead of arguing which method was better. Comparing with other methods, we consider that Borda Count Voting is the most effective and simplest way to rank those methods we have come up with.

7/31/2017 12:00:20,Team 6,Brainwriting,"During our team concept generation, we thought it would allow us to diverge from our individual concepts and create new ideas that branched off of the original. We chose this because it was a fast method to generate ideas which was what we needed at the time. It was also able to iterate quickly since team members could build off of each other's ideas. We then proceeded to discuss ideas and concepts to fill empty spaces in clusters.
","Before coming up with concepts as a group, we came to a consensus on using brainwriting. We then gave our concepts to each other and wrote ideas on them. Brainstorming came more naturally afterwards as we sat around the table and threw out ideas at each other and wrote them down as concepts.
",The Anti-Problem,"This is our most used method to come up with new ideas during both individual ideation and team ideation. Anti-problem helps to reframe the problem to be the opposite, which makes it easier to see the essence of the original problem. During brainstorming as a team, we often start by asking how might we solve the opposite problem. This helps us to start brainstorming and understand our problems better. Oftentimes, our most innovative and thoughtful ideas came from using anti-problem. Anti-problem is an effective method to help facilitate brainstorming and develop ideas. It not only started the conversation, but it also helped develop our ideas into better ones. 
","Before we came to a consensus on our methods, we all realized that anti-problem is an effective way to guide our brainstorms and develop our ideas. Since we found that this method has been really helpful to us, we finally decided to use this method after a group vote, in which we unanimously voted on this one.  
",Weighted Matrix,"After selecting the top 7 concepts by voting, we needed to find a good and effective way to organize our selection by users requirement. The weighted matrix could solve our problem because it uses weight to balance the user's requirement and find the most reasonable ideas to be developed.
","We were suggested to use borda-count voting and use of a weighted matrix to narrow down our concepts after dot voting. Weighted matrix, however, worked best because our different user needs criteria needs to have different weights in our decision making. We chose weighted matrix by coming to a group consensus.",,10
