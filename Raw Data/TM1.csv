7/13/17 23:28,Team 1,1:1 Interview,"Our team agreed to use the 1:1 Interview method to gather insight from our target market in a personal and direct fashion. We also considered using community appraisal, but decided to use 1:1 interview instead since we believe 1:1 interview allows us to narrow down our target group and understand each individual on a deeper and personal level.","Since our team is focusing on creating a product to help undergraduate students improve their health, we believe that it is essential to gather information directly from our target market on any difficulties that they have faced in maintaining their health and if they have used any other devices or products.",Open Card Sorting,"Initially, our team was choosing between closed and open card sorting method, but we came to the conclusion that open card sorting may provide useful information based on how our target consumers organize content idea cards and name each group.","We decided to go with the open card sorting method because unlike closed card sorting, where users are given only the options to use predetermined categories, open card sorting provides users the freedom to create their own set of categories. This will give us more insight on each userâ€™s unique experience and perspectives.",AEIOU,"We decided that the AEIOU method would enable us to collect observations on our target marketâ€™s daily lives in order to create a personal product. Competitive analysis was also considered by the team as an alternative method, but we ultimately decided to pursue AEIOU instead to focus more on the consumerâ€™s needs.",The AEIOU method will allow us to observe undergraduate students and their interactions to identify and analyze their everyday behavior. By taking into consideration these finding we will be able to create a product that will aid their health endeavors while also successfully merging into their lifestyle.,"Our team also considered using competitive analysis and community appraisal for our research methods, but ultimately decided to not to pursue either of these methods. We decided against using competitive analysis as this method would focus on the products currently available, whereas we wanted to focus more on the needs of our target consumers. We also decided against using community appraisal due to time constraints and instead chose to use 1:1 interviewing. Additionally we wanted to have a diverse set of methods. For example, since we chose 1:1 interview, focus group and conversation cafe shouldnâ€™t be our choice either because they are too similar.",
7/13/17 21:47,Team 2,1:1 Interview,Since we all come from different background. Early on we adopted an approach that encourage team members to present ideas back up by their reasoning. ,We are trying to improve the current medical practices and more specifically how doctors and patients can have a more efficient and meaningful engagement even outside the clinics.  ,Community Appraisal,There is a strong argument to be made about why community appraisal is more superior for our application. We each critique this method and compare it with others we've studied on the online textbook. And the benefits are very apparent to us after discussion. ,"Since we would like encourage a sense of community throughout the project, not just the from using our result product or service. So we would like to engage the community throughout the design process.  ",Usability Testing,The identified problem(s) involve two sets of participant. One is the patients; the other is the doctors. It is extremely important to for us to test the product on both users.  ,Our problems requires that two sets of user will equally find the solution appealing. Balancing the needs of these two groups are crucial to the success of our solution. ,"The various methods of categorizing observations were discussed. It seems that they offer some advantages. However, in identifying the â€œpains"" process, they are not as useful and open-ended as the three methods our team has chosen.   ",8
7/14/17 0:01,Team 3,AEIOU,"Using AEIOU as a Method of research could be helpful as we begin to study how our product interacts with our users both primary and secondary. However, at the earliest stages it is useful as a tool for evaluating the current systems that are averse to our users and their stake holders. As a research method, it requires active observation of the ecosystems the encompass our user base and is a great starting point as it allows us to understand how our users navigate their world despite their pains and how they problem solve without the help of an intervention. Our team found this method to be useful for its limited requirements. Although it may be time consuming it requires a limited amount of tools for appropriate documentation. As a team we could even make use of social media tools and technology on hand to carry out our observations.   ",Factors important to this method is the amount of time we have to observe our primary and secondary users in their current states. Also documentation the observations either through images or videos taken by hand for each team member. I also question if we might need to be more specific about our primary and secondary user base as this could be quite overwhelming and not useful in a limited time frame if we are personally observing and possibly going through the process of interacting with our users which includes individuals and organizations with a variety of independent ecosystems of their own.   For a 5 day interval AEIOU may not be appropriate and also may require more specificity and developement on the teams part to identify specifically what our user base is. Also the time it would take to prepare space and time to observe effectively may require previous knowledge of our user base which may be difficult for our secondary user base as these are organizations. Ultimately this very hands on or eyes on type of research may require preliminary steps that we are not prepared to take at this time.,Competitive Analysis,"Our team decided to conduct competitive analysis for several reasons. Primarily, the main objective with using competitive analysis was to balance the research, thereby focusing on the business applications of the product and understanding how it fits among the already incredibly diverse ecosystem of community based apps. When looking at the provided methods, we noticed that many of them were forward looking in that they made observations about the present or current experiences in order to drawn conclusions about the future. Our team selected competitive analysis primarily because it is focused on both the past and the presents, and would allow us to understand what methods of community connection have already been attempted, and in that conclude what has worked and what has not. Indeed, it is primarily for the purpose of identify opportunities in the larger market that competitive analysis was selected,allowing us to tailor the features of the product to needs( pains and gains) that the marketplace is failing to meet. This type of conclusion can only be reached through competitive analysis, as it is one of the few ways to achieve understanding of what the landscape of the productâ€™s commercial environment looks like.Therefore, we believe competitive analysis will provide beneficial, insightful information for us to craft our product to create the product-market fit that will ensure success.","Overall, the reason why competitive analysis was so highly desired when selecting methods was its marriage of feasibility and insight. Given the timeframe specified for research. It became readily apparent to the team that we needed to move quickly on any methods we chose, and therefore needed to deeply consider the ration of time to output offered by each method. Competitive analysis is a research method that requires almost no additional resources and can be conducted quickly, yet efficiently and still offers tremendous insight into the markets and products in question.Competitive analysis is also really effective as a â€˜baseâ€™ for research, and can help us identify other important components such as customer segments and key offerings. Finally, we also chose competitive analysis because it is highly adaptable. Competitive analysis can be conducted at multiple stages during the design process and can help serve as an anchor to keep our product within our target.market segment and ensuring that we are meeting the pains/gains as well as functional needs that will make our product successful.",1:1 Interview,"Our team compared all the methodologies and drew a vague categories which each belongs to. For example, we believe 1:1 interview, open card sorting, conversation cafe, and focus group are similar in the sense that they are all methodologies that can draw insight from target customer groups directly through interactions with the potential users. Among these methods, we thought that open card sorting will take more materials and prior planning, and therefore not suitable to our time-pressured research. The time limit also restricted the possibility of conducting a conversation cafe, which requires us to pull together a pool of subjects, and have them be at the same place at a given time. This is unrealistic because of summer studentsâ€™ tight schedule. Focus group puts a similar problem to us, because after our discussion, we decided that student subjects in a group probably cannot take our discussion too seriously. It is very easy for a group of college-age students to go on tangent and therefore defeats the purpose of our trying to generate useful insight for our initial product design and customer needs, pain points, as well as gain points research. We finally decided that 1:1 interview can be conducted most effectively and efficiently by each of us. We also considered the possibility that we each will be taken more seriously by student subjects if it were a private â€œconversationâ€ù (interview). We also recognized and debated about the potential limitations of this methodology, which include vague wording of the questions, vague response to the interviewers, as well as the subjectivity of a single subjects. We then talked about how we can address those concerns through more careful preparations for the interview questions and mental preparation for the subjects and ask them to please take this seriously. In short, we decided that we will use 1:1 interviews to directly generate insights about our customersâ€™ perspectives in a limited amount of research period. ","As previously mentioned in the last question, we considered the ability to generate direct feelings and comments about a topic from subjects; time-efficiency of the methods due to the short research phase; the effectiveness of direct conversation with our specific target subjects (college students). After considering all the listed factors, we decided that with careful and appropriate wording of interview questions, the subjects will be expected to reveal some specific feelings about our initial idea. We also decided that with the weekend we are given to conduct research, it would be most efficient for the five team members to split up and ask different subjects at the same time in order to generate the most and most relevant information. Last but not least, as mentioned in the previous questions, we expect the least distraction for our subjects during the conversations from other peers to side track the interview process because we assume that given the age and nature of our subjects (new college students) are generally easily peer pressured due to social needs. 1:1 interview would greatly reduce the distraction from their peers. ","We did not consider other methods. We are still in the early stages and we may benefit from further research on our user base before determining how the other methods may be useful especially when we have more specific user based goals.",9
7/13/17 23:07,Team 4,1:1 Interview,"We knew that it would be important to get deep insight into a customer's perspective on a situation. We agreed that by facilitating 1 on 1 interviews, we can discern more concretely the specific pain points and benefit a solution or problem may have.","Since we are using AEIOU and competitive analysis already, we wanted to make sure there was a method of research that was directly connected to the people our solution would identify with. The interviews would allow for a richer understanding of the customer's needs as well as the customer's own perspective of their pains/gains rather than just our perception.",Competitive Analysis,"Once we have determined the design space we find most practical to answer the challenge, we need to effectively hone in on which solutions will be most effective for our customers and end-users. By focusing on which needs are most important and result in the highest gains, with lowest negatives, the competitive analysis method allows for us to minimize issues by factoring all options upon a spectrum.","Our target population, at the moment, consists of mostly college students and young adults. Given these groups, we are likely going to focus on consumer products or services. Since this market likely already has many entries, by analyzing these competing products we may identify where they focus or fall short and thus identify potential opportunities.",AEIOU,"We believe that it is important to look at all factors at play in a situation. With that in mind, we believe that AEIOU firmly looks at all the people involved in the process and how to better deliver to them a product. This will help us better understand the needs and pains involved for us to better develop a solution for the design challenge","Finally, we felt AEIOU, helped us to identify larger trends in a userâ€™s experience that nicely complemented the specificity of interviews and the market based trends competitive analysis focused on. The activities and and objects aspects are especially valuable in our vision as they may reveal insights as to how a consumer product may improve lives.","One tough challenge was diverging from ethnographic based research. We believed that it was one of the most effective ways of understanding how to solve a problem with the end-user, but the time requirements were far too staunch to complete in four days.",9
7/13/17 19:19,Team 5,AEIOU,"We discussed this as a group over online chat, weighing this method against similar ones before deciding on AEIOU.","We considered similar methods (POSTA/POEMS) and decided on this one because we felt that the categories of Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users were the most relevant to our study of bay area transit users. We feel that this method will most effectively help us simplify information as well as make important connections between the different elements of the mnemonic.",User Observation,"Similar to the way we decided on method 1, we discussed this as a group in a chat. This method was one of the more obvious ones that we all came to agreement on quickly.","As we're trying to get information on BART riders, what better way than to go into the station and observe? We will be able to see, in context, what riders do and indirect observation will ensure that we're not influencing our customer's actions in any way.",1:1 Interview,"Again, we discussed the benefits and limitations of each method and decided that interviews would play an important role in our decision making process.","For this one we considered the ease of implementation, we chose 1:1 interviews over methods such as Conversation Cafe, for example, because it would be far more difficult and time consuming to assemble 8 people in a room for an hour. Further, we all personally know people who take the BART and are willing to interview. We also plan on conducting interviews at the stations with volunteers. We want to combine this method with User Observation, observing our participants in context before actually conducting the interview, as we feel this will be an effective way to gain different insights.","As outlined above, we chose AEIOU over POEMS as we felt the categories were more relevant. POEMS is important for understanding new markets and expanding globally, but public transit is already a well-known and wide-spread market. We chose 1:1 Interviews over Conversation Cafe as it is easier to implement in a short period of time. Also our methods were chosen based off of the period of production we are in, this is why we didn't choose Focus Group, for example, as we don't yet have a product to test.",10
7/13/17 23:27,Team 6,User Observation,"With user observation, we can collect raw insights directly from users. We firstly thought about using focus groups, but due to the lack of resources to gather a focus group we chose to use user observation instead. We are not able to use research methods that require lots of resources, like focus groups or community appraisal. User observation allows us to understand the habits and tendencies of users. This method works great especially in early stage of design since it acquires qualitative data that can effectively guide our design direction. ","The first factor we considered when choosing our research methods was the type of data we would like to collect. Since user observation gives us raw insights directly from users, it provides non-verbal information that other methods, such as 1:1 interviews, may not provide. It also nicely complements with 1:1 interviews, as we are already interviewing users at their homes. Another factor was the lack of resources, which makes methods requiring more resources, such as focus groups and community appraisal, unsuitable for this project. In contrast, user observation is more readily implementable than other methods.",1:1 Interview,It provides useful insight into our clients and goes in depth. This is also another method that our team has the resources to pursue. ,"We considered how well it complemented the other factors we chose and whether or not we had the resources to do it. This provides a deep insight into our customers which the other methods we have chosen don't provide and so gives us valuable information on what is needed and what is not. We also considered the ease of combining 1:1 interviews with user observation studies. Since we are already doing user observation at usersâ€™ homes, it is easier to conduct 1:1 interviews at usersâ€™ homes on top of user observation.",AEIOU,"We decided to use this method because we needed a method to organize the data we collect from our other two methods, and this method was more relevant to our project than POSTAS or POEMS. ","AEIOU emphasizes on activities that users do, instead of only users. Activities matters because we would like to understand which activities may pose fire hazards, and also what activities can be done to prevent fire. ","Our team was briefly considering focus groups, but we did not choose it because we lack the resources to effectively implement it.",9
