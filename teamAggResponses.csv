,Team,Module,Chosen Method,Reason,Decision Process
0,Team 1,1,1:1 Interview,"Since our team is focusing on creating a product to help undergraduate students improve their health, we believe that it is essential to gather information directly from our target market on any difficulties that they have faced in maintaining their health and if they have used any other devices or products.","Our team agreed to use the 1:1 Interview method to gather insight from our target market in a personal and direct fashion. We also considered using community appraisal, but decided to use 1:1 interview instead since we believe 1:1 interview allows us to narrow down our target group and understand each individual on a deeper and personal level."
1,Team 1,1,Open Card Sorting,"We decided to go with the open card sorting method because unlike closed card sorting, where users are given only the options to use predetermined categories, open card sorting provides users the freedom to create their own set of categories. This will give us more insight on each userÛªs unique experience and perspectives.","Initially, our team was choosing between closed and open card sorting method, but we came to the conclusion that open card sorting may provide useful information based on how our target consumers organize content idea cards and name each group."
2,Team 1,1,AEIOU,The AEIOU method will allow us to observe undergraduate students and their interactions to identify and analyze their everyday behavior. By taking into consideration these finding we will be able to create a product that will aid their health endeavors while also successfully merging into their lifestyle.,"We decided that the AEIOU method would enable us to collect observations on our target marketÛªs daily lives in order to create a personal product. Competitive analysis was also considered by the team as an alternative method, but we ultimately decided to pursue AEIOU instead to focus more on the consumerÛªs needs."
3,Team 2,1,1:1 Interview,We are trying to improve the current medical practices and more specifically how doctors and patients can have a more efficient and meaningful engagement even outside the clinics.  ,Since we all come from different background. Early on we adopted an approach that encourage team members to present ideas back up by their reasoning. 
4,Team 2,1,Community Appraisal,"Since we would like encourage a sense of community throughout the project, not just the from using our result product or service. So we would like to engage the community throughout the design process.  ",There is a strong argument to be made about why community appraisal is more superior for our application. We each critique this method and compare it with others we've studied on the online textbook. And the benefits are very apparent to us after discussion. 
5,Team 2,1,Usability Testing,Our problems requires that two sets of user will equally find the solution appealing. Balancing the needs of these two groups are crucial to the success of our solution. ,The identified problem(s) involve two sets of participant. One is the patients; the other is the doctors. It is extremely important to for us to test the product on both users.  
6,Team 3,1,AEIOU,Factors important to this method is the amount of time we have to observe our primary and secondary users in their current states. Also documentation the observations either through images or videos taken by hand for each team member. I also question if we might need to be more specific about our primary and secondary user base as this could be quite overwhelming and not useful in a limited time frame if we are personally observing and possibly going through the process of interacting with our users which includes individuals and organizations with a variety of independent ecosystems of their own.   For a 5 day interval AEIOU may not be appropriate and also may require more specificity and developement on the teams part to identify specifically what our user base is. Also the time it would take to prepare space and time to observe effectively may require previous knowledge of our user base which may be difficult for our secondary user base as these are organizations. Ultimately this very hands on or eyes on type of research may require preliminary steps that we are not prepared to take at this time.,"Using AEIOU as a Method of research could be helpful as we begin to study how our product interacts with our users both primary and secondary. However, at the earliest stages it is useful as a tool for evaluating the current systems that are averse to our users and their stake holders. As a research method, it requires active observation of the ecosystems the encompass our user base and is a great starting point as it allows us to understand how our users navigate their world despite their pains and how they problem solve without the help of an intervention. Our team found this method to be useful for its limited requirements. Although it may be time consuming it requires a limited amount of tools for appropriate documentation. As a team we could even make use of social media tools and technology on hand to carry out our observations.   "
7,Team 3,1,Competitive Analysis,"Overall, the reason why competitive analysis was so highly desired when selecting methods was its marriage of feasibility and insight. Given the timeframe specified for research. It became readily apparent to the team that we needed to move quickly on any methods we chose, and therefore needed to deeply consider the ration of time to output offered by each method. Competitive analysis is a research method that requires almost no additional resources and can be conducted quickly, yet efficiently and still offers tremendous insight into the markets and products in question.Competitive analysis is also really effective as a Û÷baseÛª for research, and can help us identify other important components such as customer segments and key offerings. Finally, we also chose competitive analysis because it is highly adaptable. Competitive analysis can be conducted at multiple stages during the design process and can help serve as an anchor to keep our product within our target.market segment and ensuring that we are meeting the pains/gains as well as functional needs that will make our product successful.","Our team decided to conduct competitive analysis for several reasons. Primarily, the main objective with using competitive analysis was to balance the research, thereby focusing on the business applications of the product and understanding how it fits among the already incredibly diverse ecosystem of community based apps. When looking at the provided methods, we noticed that many of them were forward looking in that they made observations about the present or current experiences in order to drawn conclusions about the future. Our team selected competitive analysis primarily because it is focused on both the past and the presents, and would allow us to understand what methods of community connection have already been attempted, and in that conclude what has worked and what has not. Indeed, it is primarily for the purpose of identify opportunities in the larger market that competitive analysis was selected,allowing us to tailor the features of the product to needs( pains and gains) that the marketplace is failing to meet. This type of conclusion can only be reached through competitive analysis, as it is one of the few ways to achieve understanding of what the landscape of the productÛªs commercial environment looks like.Therefore, we believe competitive analysis will provide beneficial, insightful information for us to craft our product to create the product-market fit that will ensure success."
8,Team 3,1,1:1 Interview,"As previously mentioned in the last question, we considered the ability to generate direct feelings and comments about a topic from subjects; time-efficiency of the methods due to the short research phase; the effectiveness of direct conversation with our specific target subjects (college students). After considering all the listed factors, we decided that with careful and appropriate wording of interview questions, the subjects will be expected to reveal some specific feelings about our initial idea. We also decided that with the weekend we are given to conduct research, it would be most efficient for the five team members to split up and ask different subjects at the same time in order to generate the most and most relevant information. Last but not least, as mentioned in the previous questions, we expect the least distraction for our subjects during the conversations from other peers to side track the interview process because we assume that given the age and nature of our subjects (new college students) are generally easily peer pressured due to social needs. 1:1 interview would greatly reduce the distraction from their peers. ","Our team compared all the methodologies and drew a vague categories which each belongs to. For example, we believe 1:1 interview, open card sorting, conversation cafe, and focus group are similar in the sense that they are all methodologies that can draw insight from target customer groups directly through interactions with the potential users. Among these methods, we thought that open card sorting will take more materials and prior planning, and therefore not suitable to our time-pressured research. The time limit also restricted the possibility of conducting a conversation cafe, which requires us to pull together a pool of subjects, and have them be at the same place at a given time. This is unrealistic because of summer studentsÛª tight schedule. Focus group puts a similar problem to us, because after our discussion, we decided that student subjects in a group probably cannot take our discussion too seriously. It is very easy for a group of college-age students to go on tangent and therefore defeats the purpose of our trying to generate useful insight for our initial product design and customer needs, pain points, as well as gain points research. We finally decided that 1:1 interview can be conducted most effectively and efficiently by each of us. We also considered the possibility that we each will be taken more seriously by student subjects if it were a private ÛÏconversationÛ (interview). We also recognized and debated about the potential limitations of this methodology, which include vague wording of the questions, vague response to the interviewers, as well as the subjectivity of a single subjects. We then talked about how we can address those concerns through more careful preparations for the interview questions and mental preparation for the subjects and ask them to please take this seriously. In short, we decided that we will use 1:1 interviews to directly generate insights about our customersÛª perspectives in a limited amount of research period. "
9,Team 4,1,1:1 Interview,"Since we are using AEIOU and competitive analysis already, we wanted to make sure there was a method of research that was directly connected to the people our solution would identify with. The interviews would allow for a richer understanding of the customer's needs as well as the customer's own perspective of their pains/gains rather than just our perception.","We knew that it would be important to get deep insight into a customer's perspective on a situation. We agreed that by facilitating 1 on 1 interviews, we can discern more concretely the specific pain points and benefit a solution or problem may have."
10,Team 4,1,Competitive Analysis,"Our target population, at the moment, consists of mostly college students and young adults. Given these groups, we are likely going to focus on consumer products or services. Since this market likely already has many entries, by analyzing these competing products we may identify where they focus or fall short and thus identify potential opportunities.","Once we have determined the design space we find most practical to answer the challenge, we need to effectively hone in on which solutions will be most effective for our customers and end-users. By focusing on which needs are most important and result in the highest gains, with lowest negatives, the competitive analysis method allows for us to minimize issues by factoring all options upon a spectrum."
11,Team 4,1,AEIOU,"Finally, we felt AEIOU, helped us to identify larger trends in a userÛªs experience that nicely complemented the specificity of interviews and the market based trends competitive analysis focused on. The activities and and objects aspects are especially valuable in our vision as they may reveal insights as to how a consumer product may improve lives.","We believe that it is important to look at all factors at play in a situation. With that in mind, we believe that AEIOU firmly looks at all the people involved in the process and how to better deliver to them a product. This will help us better understand the needs and pains involved for us to better develop a solution for the design challenge"
12,Team 5,1,AEIOU,"We considered similar methods (POSTA/POEMS) and decided on this one because we felt that the categories of Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users were the most relevant to our study of bay area transit users. We feel that this method will most effectively help us simplify information as well as make important connections between the different elements of the mnemonic.","We discussed this as a group over online chat, weighing this method against similar ones before deciding on AEIOU."
13,Team 5,1,User Observation,"As we're trying to get information on BART riders, what better way than to go into the station and observe? We will be able to see, in context, what riders do and indirect observation will ensure that we're not influencing our customer's actions in any way.","Similar to the way we decided on method 1, we discussed this as a group in a chat. This method was one of the more obvious ones that we all came to agreement on quickly."
14,Team 5,1,1:1 Interview,"For this one we considered the ease of implementation, we chose 1:1 interviews over methods such as Conversation Cafe, for example, because it would be far more difficult and time consuming to assemble 8 people in a room for an hour. Further, we all personally know people who take the BART and are willing to interview. We also plan on conducting interviews at the stations with volunteers. We want to combine this method with User Observation, observing our participants in context before actually conducting the interview, as we feel this will be an effective way to gain different insights.","Again, we discussed the benefits and limitations of each method and decided that interviews would play an important role in our decision making process."
15,Team 6,1,User Observation,"The first factor we considered when choosing our research methods was the type of data we would like to collect. Since user observation gives us raw insights directly from users, it provides non-verbal information that other methods, such as 1:1 interviews, may not provide. It also nicely complements with 1:1 interviews, as we are already interviewing users at their homes. Another factor was the lack of resources, which makes methods requiring more resources, such as focus groups and community appraisal, unsuitable for this project. In contrast, user observation is more readily implementable than other methods.","With user observation, we can collect raw insights directly from users. We firstly thought about using focus groups, but due to the lack of resources to gather a focus group we chose to use user observation instead. We are not able to use research methods that require lots of resources, like focus groups or community appraisal. User observation allows us to understand the habits and tendencies of users. This method works great especially in early stage of design since it acquires qualitative data that can effectively guide our design direction. "
16,Team 6,1,1:1 Interview,"We considered how well it complemented the other factors we chose and whether or not we had the resources to do it. This provides a deep insight into our customers which the other methods we have chosen don't provide and so gives us valuable information on what is needed and what is not. We also considered the ease of combining 1:1 interviews with user observation studies. Since we are already doing user observation at usersÛª homes, it is easier to conduct 1:1 interviews at usersÛª homes on top of user observation.",It provides useful insight into our clients and goes in depth. This is also another method that our team has the resources to pursue. 
17,Team 6,1,AEIOU,"AEIOU emphasizes on activities that users do, instead of only users. Activities matters because we would like to understand which activities may pose fire hazards, and also what activities can be done to prevent fire. ","We decided to use this method because we needed a method to organize the data we collect from our other two methods, and this method was more relevant to our project than POSTAS or POEMS. "
18,Team 1,2,Empathy Map,"Since we are aiming to help alleviate some of our customerÛªs personal health concerns, we felt that empathizing with them would allow us to better understand the causes for their poor health and therefore create better pain relievers for our customers. This method is great for gaining a different perspective since it allows us to put ourselves in our userÛªs shoes.","All members of the team unanimously decided to use empathy map as one of our analysis methods in order to empathize and better understand the struggles of our customersÛª lives. After doing initial research, this method can help us organize observations and gain deeper insights."
19,Team 1,2,Affinity Diagramming,"After out 1:1 interviews, our team had a lot of information to try and sift through, thus we selected the affinity diagram method to sort through all this information and find common themes in the information the interviewees were relaying to us. After sorting a large amount of data into logical groups, we can figure out clearer ideas for  next stage.","The members in our group are all creative, and the method are suggested to use in situations when every team member has different opinions on how to proceed. So, we choose this method to help solicit ideas from our group and obtain consensus on how information should be structured. The method helps us to figure out the idea, as well as their importance. "
20,Team 1,2,Concept Map,Our main motivator for choosing concept mapping as one of our analysis methods was to have a visual representation of how the information our prospective customers were relaying to us. By having this visual and understanding how the information is interrelated we can then figure out where to focus our energy for the ideation state and what pain we are hoping our product relieves.,"After considering other methods for analysis, our team agreed the best method for our project would be Concept mapping. Although there are other methods similar to concept mappings, we felt that they did not provide as broad of a horizon on the issue or as deep insights as concept mapping."
21,Team 2,2,Empathy Map,"Do: 1. My medical apartments have CCTV to record the whole operation procedure, and have experienced doctors guide me by my side; 2. IÛªd love to talk more about this idea; 3.I would participate if the product was well designed.Think: 1. I think we should deal with picture clarity problem. 2. I think we should take responsibility into consideration.Feel: 1. Positive__ Interesting,help more inexperienced doctor get more guidance, curious 2. Negative: clarity, hard to realize.Gains:1. Build a collective knowledge base cross reference; 2.treat patients with confidence. 3.good PR for the medical industry.Pains: 1. Not sure if the diagnosis is 100% accurate; 2. Cannot consult other doctorsÛª opinions; 3.for beginning doctors, they especially need this validation of their diagnosis; 4.no rich record of the diagnosing process other than text information.","Empathy map is a efficient method to organize observations and representing our user. Our team think we should focus on our customers, combine four quadrants (say_Î do_Î think_Î feel) together.We consider four methods as follows.Doctors said: 1.The  idea of this technology is great; 2. different doctors have different diagnosis and treatment measures, nobody can ensure which measure would lead to better results;; 3. When we take suggestions from other doctors, if his condition becomes deteriorated, who will take the responsibility;4.how to guaranteeing the sharpness of video when the doctors are keeping moving "
22,Team 2,2,Mind Map,It's really hard to start from the first/early stage. We need to find all sorts of information from all dimensions. What the doctors and patients said may vary greatly. So it's really important to use a method to sort out all kinds of data and find a cue to combine all of these and tag them to help visualize.,Mind map is a quick way to generate and organize infromation from our users and we can classify different opinions from patients and doctors to make them visualize and connect to each other.
23,Team 2,2,2x2 Matrix,"2x2 Matrix can provide a clear view of the current market condition and the trend of its development. By using this method, we can know what kind of product will best fit the market. We can find out the gap in the current medical market and capture the need of doctors and patients.","Since there are lots of products in the market with the same or alike functions, we should find out their market positions, so we can precisely identify the opportunity space for ours. We think it's the best way to determine the general direction for our project."
24,Team 3,2,Concept Map," The two primary reasons that our team decided to select the concept map framework was because of its adaptability and its explanatory power in the context of relationships. From our research, we concluded that our potential users had extremely divergent needs when it came to transitioning from Berkeley. The concept map framework allows for many different nodes to be displayed and examined at once, and is therefore perfect for the nature of the data that our team collected. Additionally, given the limited timeframe, we determined that the flexible nature of the concept map would allow us to utilize other methods( atomize, etc) in the context of the concept map in places that we felt needed further investigation. The advantage of the concept map is it is easily scalable, so we would be able to have a central guide that we are able to continuously refer back to during the analysis and serve as an organizer for all our other methods. In this way, the concept map become the center of our analysis process from which all other flows are derived. ","Our team decided on using the concept map method through examining all of the methods each individual member had selected and discussing the pros and cons of each method. There was no formal selection procedure (i.e. voting) but rather we all generally agreed that this would be an excellent framework from which to conduct the analysis portion. The decision was unanimous as together we discovered the majority of us had selected this method or considered selecting this method in the individual survey so we felt it only natural for it to be featured in the main analysis phase. Overall, the selection was rather harmonious, indicating that this will be a good method for our team to invest our time in. "
25,Team 3,2,Task Analysis,"We decided on this method primarily because of the complicated nature of a studentÛªs life and the need to tackle a specific problem. Since our primary customer group that we identified is international students, there are so much more aspects and daily jobs they carry than other student groups; however, at the same time, their jobs also include most of the other studentsÛª jobs. Because students tackle different problems and assignments on a daily basis and generally have some vague big goals in mind, it is even more important for us as ÛÏdesignersÛ to relieve their pains and create their gains to break down what they do everyday and their overarching goals to find out what is actually creating stress and bumps in their lives. We also decided to use the hierarchical task analysis in order to prioritize their many pain points and gain points and we hope that through this method, we could decide based on the analysis on which part of their lives do we want to improve.  ","After evaluating all the options and pictured all the methods in the context of our research, we narrowed down to a handful of options that would fit in the time frame and be feasible with our target customer -- students. Rose proposed that a task analysis would be reasonable because during our previous phase, weÛªve identified so many key jobs that students carry on a daily basis and a task analysis would help us organize the data about students fairly well and break some of the key tasks down for us to get insights. Everyone nodded and showed that he/she agrees. We then discussed the possibility of ways that we use this method and the more we talk about it, the more feasible it appeared to us so we were sure by the end of this part of decision making. "
26,Team 3,2,Customer Journey Mapping,.Factors that were considered for this approach were collaboration with stakeholders. With this method we are able to directly interact with the daily routine of our users. They can begin to draw out and even mention their anecdotal experience. It allows for visual communication and info gathering otherwise not attainable through methods of interview or other static data gathering. Also allows us to understand the emotional viewpoint of our stakeholders what drives them. Factors that affect the effectiveness of this method include not being a very detailed way of info gathering and its also not linear so the documentor or visualizer may have a hard time transferring into image the overall view. The design team also needs to be able to empathize and maybe understand the emotional perspective of the user so to effectively tell the story from the side of the user.. However since we are interviewing people and using methods such as AEIOU it will be helpful to have visual clues that offer the opportunity to capture quickly without expert knowledge and to break down their experience as holistic events.,"Charlie proposed this method and we all at the same time agreed that this was a good idea. We started talking about why we wanted it and therefore convinced everyone on the team that we want to add this map toward our analysis. Over the discussion, we talked about that we needed more visual + analysis type of method and customer journey map seemed fun and pretty to all of us. We raised concern that a studentÛªs daily life or a task often consists of a lot of trivial details that could be hard to keep track and all displayed on one map; however, eventually we decided that this is exactly why we would like to map the ÛÏjourneyÛ out in details to remind us of the details we often neglect but that may be important to how we feel everyday. Therefore, after a little bump in the decision making process, we reached unanimous agreement on this analysis method."
27,Team 4,2,Reframing,"Our research focused on a fairly specific issue of safety during transit around campus. Since this topic has been approached many times with fairly similar solution and also already includes many university-offered solutions, reframing the question would perhaps help to broaden our view and find different answers that may be more relatable to the design challenge of mobile sensing.","After having finished the research, we tried to find the methods that best made sense to us and also would best complement the type of data we had acquired. We knew that campus safety was a very saturated topic and wanted to ensure we found new and unique ways to approach the issue and thus chose reframing to try to find fresh solutions."
28,Team 4,2,Atomize,"Atomization seems like a natural extension of the combination of knowledge found through AEIOU research and 1:1 interviews. By reducing the larger topic to its most basic constituents, we are able to get an extract to build larger ideas off of. It fits well since it allows us to frame all our findings and have a visual discussion over the next step  in our system.","Again, in trying to find design methods that complemented our research, we came across atomization. While everyone had a very general idea of what was generally associated with campus transit and safety, atomization allows us to perhaps discover details we were not aware of that may provide a solution or a new facet of safety."
29,Team 4,2,2x2 Matrix,"As previously mentioned, during class, our use of the 2x2 matrix with safety and convenience along one axis and student/caretaker along the other helped to reveal valuable insight. By continuing use of this method with other interesting factors, we hope to find useful trends as well as opportunity to design.","While we initially did not select this method, our exploration with it in todayÛªs class revealed that the 2x2 matrix was more important that we initially thought as it revealed certain trends through axes that we did not already consider."
30,Team 5,2,Why-how Laddering,We think this method would be a great way to flesh out customer needs from different areas ranging from practical to emotional and social.,One team member suggested this method and others readily agreed.
31,Team 5,2,Customer Journey Mapping,"User experience data is clearly organized by diagram in Customer Journey Mapping, and the relations between each element is easy to read.",We are highly focusing on BART usersÛª riding experience. We all agree on this method to go deeper understanding of users.
32,Team 5,2,Kano Analysis,"It lets us prioritize and categorize all the different features weÛªre thinking about. In addition, we will build up a better understanding of the factors which influence customers enjoyable level of riding BART.",One of our team member points out that we need a method to categorize so many features that we came out of our product. All members agree.
33,Team 6,2,Empathy Map,"We chose this method so that we could understand our customer better. This method also complements the why-how laddering because that goes very deep into their needs and identifies the base need while this works at a slightly higher level and allows us to empathize with the customer. By doing so, we can better create a product that suits their needs. This is an appropriate method for tackling the challenge because it forces us into the minds of the user instead of the designer and gives us a holistic view which is very useful for creating an effective design","We took a vote on the three methods to use and empathy map had a large number of votes. From there, we discussed our options until we reached a consensus to use this method."
34,Team 6,2,2x2 Matrix,"Our other two methods focused on better understanding the consumer. This method complements them by allowing us to narrow down the needs into what we can implement well. This is an appropriate method because given our time constraint, we cannot work on everything at once and we must prioritize. The 2x2 matrix helps to do that.",We took a vote on which 3 methods to use and this gained enough votes to go onto the discussion. We discussed our options and and reached a consensus to use this method.
35,Team 6,2,Why-how Laddering,"We believe that by using this method, we can understand the root needs of people. By knowing what our customer wants deep down, we can better create a product that fits them. We think it is an appropriate method because it works with the amount of data that we have and it helps us understand the customer very well which is an important aspect of design.",We took a vote on the three methods and this was one of the methods that we chose unanimously.
36,Team 1,3,6-Up Sketches,"Since our goal during the ideate stage was to exchange ideas and generate as many design concepts as possible, we needed a method that promotes creative thinking and group discussion. We thought that 6-Up Sketches was a very good method for idea exchange since it allows each individual to introduce their top six designs with the rest of the team using sketches. We really liked the use of sketches as a way to present ideas since visuals are great for understanding a concept or product design.","After reviewing the different methods in lecture, we talked amongst ourselves and discussed the pros and cons of each method to choose the one that is most useful. One team member suggested that 6-Up sketches is a great method to start out with since it allows each member to draw and write up their 6 best ideas to share with the group. After reaching group consensus, we began sketching out our ideas individually. "
37,Team 1,3,6-3-5 Brainwriting,"We considered the pros and cons of this method. 6-3-5 Brainwriting allows us to develop each team memberâs ideas as well as to write down new ideas inspired by them. Because each round of idea generation is only 5 minutes and there are a total of six rounds, we are able to generate many ideas using this method. One limitation that we considered was the pressure and stress from the time constraint may reduce the quality of our ideas. However, we felt that the pros outweighed the con and for this reason, we chose this method. ","Now that weâve got our best ideas out in the open, it was time to generate more ideas. One member suggested using 6-3-5 Brainwriting as our next ideation method due to it yielding many concepts in a short amount of time. After considering the pros (generates many ideas, saves time, efficiency) and cons (time pressure may affect quality of ideas) of this method as a group, we reached group consensus once again and began exercising this method. "
38,Team 1,3,Brainstorming,"The reason why we chose Brainstorming is because this method is freeform and lacks any method guidelines, which allows room for exploration, flexibility and creativity. We believed that having this freedom will aid us in thinking outside of the box and generating unprecedented design concepts. This method also allows for both individual work and group collaboration by using different ways of brainstorming.","Due to time restraints for generating design concepts during lecture, our team was unable to generate 60 ideas by the end of lecture. In order to come up with additional ideas, our team decided to brainstorm and add ideas to our spreadsheet. "
39,Team 2,3,Visual Brainstorming,"Through this method, it helps us to figure out many thoughts that canât be express clearly. And when someone shows a picture, we may have some questions towards this, then we will think of some related situations or solutions to this problem. This helps us to enlarge our project and we consider this to be a main factor for us to choose this method.","Visual Brainstorming helps us to get a better understanding of whatâs our exact thinking is, sometimes it may be a little hard to express only by words. Also, visual pictures can give us a vivid description of our insights and it may arouse other insights if someone else sees your pictures."
40,Team 2,3,3-12-3 Brainstorming,"The factors we considered is whether we could generate ideas in such a short time without any laborious discussion and whether this idea can improve our existing project and strategy. Luckily, we did! I highly recommend this method because in such a fast paced process, we could explore deeper mind to make decisions, and we can generate more ideas than just sit listless and think the ideas.","3-12-3 Brainstorming provides us so limited time to brainstorming and presenting the ideas we generated. Our team decide on using this method because it gives us time pressure, make use of the class time to brainstorm and generate ideas, express our ideas in the group. Though we canât generate lots of ideas in a such a short time, we still try it!"
41,Team 2,3,Attribute Listing,"In an integrated system, every parts act in their functions. We thought using Attribute Listing to separate links apart can greatly add possibility and variety to our product. Thus it helps us to come up with more creative ideas with quality.","In ideate process, we wants to get as more ideas as possible. Using the attribute listing, we can combine different functions together to form a complicated system and gain more ideas in shorter time."
42,Team 3,3,Brainstorming,"
 In terms of structure, our team decided to take a âround robin approach in which we all took turns coming up with an idea and then gave feedback. After, we each took 10-15 min to sketch down the ideas that we had brainstormed while incorporating the feedback we received from round one. We then conducted another round of feedback with all of our completed ideas. From there we each used dot voting to select what our team believed to be the most viable of the ideas and did yet another round of brainstorming as to what these concepts would look like fleshed out, thus combining design-the-box in our brainstorming portion. By having multiple rounds of this brainstorming/feedback loop, we believe that we narrowed down our ideation process to produce both quantity and quality which made the clustering process easier, thus hopefully leading to a smooth creation process. 
","Our team opted to using brainstorming as one of our ideation methods due to the difficult time constraints and freedom offered by the process. We were all familiar with collective brainstorming as a process, and as a result of the completion of the 10 individual ideas, we were in a  good position to have a productive ideation/brainstorming session. We arrived at the consensus through discussion and then a vote, which was unanimously in favor of utilizing the brainstorming process. "
43,Team 3,3,Design Heuristics,"The main factors that contributed to our decision in choosing design heuristics are fun and fluidity of the ideation process. We want the ideation process to be fun for all the members so that we do not get discouraged by sudden writer'sâ block in coming up with so many ideas. We also want the ideation process to be mostly a team effort and keep everyone in the team engaged in the idea generation, evaluation, and combination. One of the main problems we encountered individually when we were coming up with our own concepts was that we seemed to be fixated on a few features of the solutions and cannot seem to create more new ideas. After we started using the cards, we realized that design heuristics is good for both team communication, spirit, and individual writerâs blocks in the ideation process.","As a team, we first were experimenting with different methods when we were first asked to start ideating in class. After the guest speakerâs lectures and detailed explanations of different ideation methods, we thought that design heuristics would be a fun team activity and helpful in developing various ideas that we came up with. A little bit into the ideation stage, Rose went up and took some design heuristics cards and shared it with the team. Our team all started to pull the cards and experiment with it. Later on in the decision making process, Imani proposed that this should be one of our three ideating methods, and the team unanimously agreed that it is a fun process and help generate interesting and unique ideas. "
44,Team 3,3,Weighted Matrix,"Overall, they reason why weighted matrix was chosen when selecting methods was its accuracy. Given a lot of option we concluded. We are supposed to quantitative analyse all opinions and rank them to have specific sequence. By using weighted matrix, weighted scores are summed, giving a total score for each designed method. This is our teamâs decision-making process.","Our team chose weighted matrix as one of us ideation method due to the decision make in comparing different supplies. Weighted matrices can be used to evaluate and prioritize alternative design options during concept evaluation.We have already come up with several design opinions but the thing is we also have diverse tendency towards each opinions. Each design option is numerically scored for each criterion and this score is multiplied by the criterionâs weight by using this method.Therefore, we believe weighted matrix will provide us with accurate, scored opinion."
45,Team 3,3,Brainstorming," In terms of structure, our team decided to take a âround robin approach in which we all took turns coming up with an idea and then gave feedback. After, we each took 10-15 min to sketch down the ideas that we had brainstormed while incorporating the feedback we received from round one. We then conducted another round of feedback with all of our completed ideas. From there we each used dot voting to select what our team believed to be the most viable of the ideas and did yet another round of brainstorming as to what these concepts would look like fleshed out, thus combining design-the-box in our brainstorming portion. By having multiple rounds of this brainstorming/feedback loop, we believe that we narrowed down our ideation process to produce both quantity and quality which made the clustering process easier, thus hopefully leading to a smooth creation process. ","Our team opted to using brainstorming as one of our ideation methods due to the difficult time constraints and freedom offered by the process.

51,Team 4,3,Borda Count Voting,"As we needed to narrow down the many options we had initially come up with, we decided to use borda vote counting as one of the methods of selection. The high degree of specificity with which the system ranked, we felt was extremely valuable whereas dot voting left us with many ties. As such we used dot voting to do an initial round of selection then borda vote counting for our final round.","While we were in class working on the process of reducing our selections, Borda vote counting was an immediate choice as we needed a way to quickly find our top 3 concepts."
52,Team 4,3,Brainstorming,"We specifically chose brainstorming as a collaborative method over other methods like brainwriting as our group preferred a vocal method of sharing ideas whereas brainwriting was very silent. The nature of brainstorming being more of a collaborative, group activity allows everyone to contribute more equally and build off of each otherâs ideas to create more sophisticated solutions.","After finishing the initial in class exercise of individual ideation, we needed a method to combine our ideas and create new ones, and thus brainstorming was a natural solution."
53,Team 4,3,The Anti-Problem,"The anti-problem interesting method utilized across the group largely for its ability to provide solutions from a perspective. It is easy to get locked into creating that only address one aspect of the issue. However, anti-problem allowed us to analyze our initial issues from strange new viewpoints that may not have seemed intuitive but actually provided very relevant solutions.
","The anti-problem was a common ideation method used throughout our group during the individual ideation exercise. While it is not the only method we used, we chose to include this in our final 3 methods as it produced some of the most interesting results."
54,Team 1,4,Prototyping,"Prototyping allows us to make our ideas tangible by creating physical representations through a multitude of techniques such as laser cutting and tangible prototyping. Â It can reduce the risk of costly development, making sure whether the product work as expected. Having physical representations and models allows us to better understand our designs since our team and the users can physically interact with it.","Since our design team is in the build stage and deciding the best way of working on a physical product that will incorporate mobile sensing, we felt that prototyping would be the most applicable to our project. "
55,Team 1,4,Tangible Prototype,"Tangible prototype is great because the method allows us to quickly test functions and features of our design ideas. Another useful property of this method is that it does not require any special or technical skills, which means that everyone in the group can contribute equally.
Â Â Â  This method can help a lot when developing our product. With more prototypes, we gather more information, which gives us great insight to improve our product. From this procedure, we find it really useful to figure out our shortcoming through building different prototypes, so we will continue building prototype if the conditions are permitted.","Our team agreed that using tangible prototyping to create a physical model of our design concept with the critical features, would be very useful in determining how we should proceed forward. And we can easily find materials like cardboard and scrap in the classroom for this method. "
56,Team 1,4,Rapid Prototyping,"Our team had yet to decide which our three concepts we were going to move forward with, thus we felt that using rapid prototyping, with other teams acting as our customer insight, would help us decide which concept would be most beneficial to our target customers and which features they felt would be most important. Information gathered from the first round would then be used to chose a design concept to move forward with and improve based on suggestions. We also considered the limitations we had with time and resources. Since we only had less than a week to build our product, we decided that rapid prototype is a great way for us to get through multiple iterations and improve our product.","Several group members suggested using this method due to its benefit of achieving multiple rounds of iteration. We quickly reached group consensus and began creating our first prototype. Since we are limited on time, this method can save a great amount of time for us."
57,Team 2,4,Wireframe,"Efficiency and visualization may be the main factors that we consider very important. By using this method, we can efficiently present our ideas directly and clearly. We wonât come across the problems that we canât express ourselves clearly or we canât find out how the programming works. Our aim is to show the users how does our product work and how to use it. Wireframe can help tackle the challenge by creating visual design layouts and can be added to the brainstorming process where we can develop our design by receiving more feedbacks.","A wireframe is a user interface like a screen or web page. It can visually depict the layout of an app. In our product, we create a Medicine Box which is connected to the app to remind people to take the medicine on time. There may be different screens to show which medicine you need to take and screens in various colors to inform you. So by using this method, itâs the quickest and easiest way to present our ideas as well as adding some more screens to it. Instead of spend much time on the programming, wireframe can also achieve our goals and test the functionality and show our product to the users directly and clearly."
58,Team 2,4,Experience Prototype,"The first factor our group considered is the feedback from users. In order to get the feedback, we can interview our users, which we had completed. In this step, is time to build our product, the best way to get feedback and improve our product is let the old patients to experience the product themselves.","Using this method, provides us a chance to show and test our design via active user participation, we can easily get feedback and make major design changes and decisions in the early stages of product development. Through this method, we can easily and quickly get the feedback of our product, and ensures this product is focus on user-centered. To be more specific, in our project, we want to design a medicine box that remind old patients to take medicine on time. Once we have made our product, we are eager to get feedback from old patients and other groups, only in this way, can we improve the role of products."
59,Team 2,4,Fused Deposition Models,"Since our team is doing a medical project in a short time, the time efficiency seems especially important. By using FDM 3D printing, the prototype can be produced quickly and with high quality. Thus we will have more time to improve our prototype and add more function to it.","Our team chose this building method because we thought it is the quickest and easiest way to build prototype. 3D printing models are delicate and low-cost, so we can express our ideas better. "
60,Team 3,4,Wireframe,"We chose wireframe as our build method mainly because the character like visualized, effective and sketch-like. Our design is based on Berkeley map to develop all other concept. The design solution requires both time counting system and the information from users. Wireframe provide us with a more elaborated function. ","Wireframes visually depict the rudimentary layout of an app or website.  This method can be really suitable for our product. At the very begining, we decided to use wireframes to present and improve our app."
61,Team 3,4,Prototyping,"The main factors that contributed to our decision in choosing prototyping are tangible, visualized, fun and good operability. Cause build process is a qualitative leap. Our product are not in draft anymore. First of all, we want this process is easy to operate, prototypes are low resolution artifacts and can be anything that a user can interact with. We just use some simple material like clay, cardboards,papers to finish our product. Second, our product is a simple applicant with three main concept. We want to make it tangible to present all this features accurately. Third, we want all team members could get involved and have fun. In this build process, we confront some problems like surface designing and convergence between pages. But with team communication and improvement, we fix all these. This method can help us improve our product.","In ideate step, we brainstormed many ideas and refined to 3 main concepts. From then on, our group want to build a tangible product to present our ideas. When we saw the varied material that Mr. Kim offered to us, the prototyping could be a really fun activity and helpful in showing our applicant. Imani took some clay and cardboard, she made an impressive 3 dimension map. And other team member use some other simple material to build an artificial mobile phone."
62,Team 3,4,Service Prototype,"The factors that contributed to our decision was that our app required peope to interactive with existing businesses and processes so it was a a great opportunity to see if your idea was useful in these circumstances one being the meeting and scheduling of an advising appointment. Finding a good place to eat that is also a short wait and last was finding a good place to network with people you like.
",Allowing users to go through the service allowed us to understand what problems might arries from the service and errors created even from our solutions.

"
65,Team 3,4,Wireframe,We considered the amount of features in our app and  it was the most appropriate to show the variety of functions within a single unit.,Wire framing was best because we had an app. It was a very simple way to organize our idea and show in a progressive fashion how our product works.
66,Team 4,4,Wireframe,"Our design solution requires  both  a smart street light/waypoint system along with a way to access them as well as relay the information collected back to the user, so wireframe offered the ideal method to quickly come up with the screens the app should offer and how the app would function. It provides a great starting point to continue building off of for higher fidelity prototypes.
","Wireframe is the build method given that most directly addresses application building, so we knew it would be a crucial method for our project.
"
67,Team 4,4,Tangible Prototype,"The vision for our design solution is very grounded in a physical product complimented by a digital interface. So in order to represent that well, we feel that there is definitely a need for some physical model of the waypoints that relates to the app we create. We want to ensure that the app is not the primary focus as the solution actually aims to reduce phone usage while walking.
","While building a full scale street lamp seems a bit of a tall order, we definitely want to create something tangible that combines the app and perhaps a scale model of the waypoints.
"
68,Team 4,4,Rapid Prototyping,"Given the length of the class, some of the more uncommon rapid fabrication techniques may not be ideal or familiar. We left it a bit more open at rapid prototyping, but 3D printing or laser cutting may be likely choices. These methods would allow us to easily create model waypoints from 3D models and thus allow us to quickly create medium fidelity prototypes as well as possibly iterate on those prototypes.
","This method goes hand in hand with our necessity of a physical complement to our application portion. Weâve largely focused on the app prior, so rapid prototyping would be a good way to quickly create higher fidelity physical prototypes.
"
69,Team 5,4,Wireframe,"We needed a way to visualize the mobile design of our product. This method allows us to prioritize content and categorize/structure our productâs services into menu items. We will be able to get a better understanding of how we want our application to work. This method is also desirable because it is a low-fidelity means of prototyping and we only have a short amount of time to implement it.
","We agreed on this method the quickest because our product relies on a mobile interface to communicate information.
"
70,Team 5,4,Prototyping,"We needed a way to validate and demonstrate the mobile design of product. Prototyping provide an effective and simple way to transform our abstract ideas into concrete example in order to help anchor a discussion about the design, which is very important to our product.This method is also a bridge helping us to communicate and convince a client of the feasibility of a project.
 
","Undoubtedly, we need this method to make ours abstract ideas real.
As a result, we all agree this method!
"
71,Team 5,4,Experience Prototype,"The App that weâre designing has various features and functions. As a result, with experiential prototyping, we may be able to test out different versions of the prototype. For example, we could omit several features in one version while keeping the omitted features in the other versions, in an attempt to find out the consumer preference of the features.
","The development of the product is currently one thatâs low-fidelity, i.e. the consumers may not stick to or even begin using the product without proper instruction or assistance. My team and I would provide the necessary help to the consumers when they try out the prototype for the first time. 

"
72,Team 1,5,Design Roadmap,"   After the second peer review, we received some feedback from potential users and professors that throwing out the trash is just a gain but not a necessary need for undergraduates students. Using roadmapping, we were able to identify other limitations and issues with our product such as the need for a sorting feature and the lack of awareness for environmental and waste management of our users. Roadmapping can help us think step by step, recognizing our original thought and then expand to future development.",      Our team has some confusion and uncertainty of our product and Roadmapping is useful when we need to consolidate results and extract insights. So we choose this method to help us clarify our targeted function and potential users. Roadmapping also really helps with planning ahead for future applications and improvements we can make on our product. 
73,Team 1,5,Storyboards,"	When choosing the storyboarding method, our team took into consideration the benefits of having a visual in communicating our ideas and process. Since storyboard involves creating a roadmap of our ideas and implementation process, itâs very useful for planning out our presentation. As indicated on the DesignExchange website, Storyboard is used as a tool to help you visualize and organize your ideas into coherent presentation. Itâs essential for us to tell a story through our presentation as it is more engaging for the audience and effective to get our message across. We also considered the method because it allows for everyone in the team to contribute to the process.  ","	Through group discussion, our team agreed that using a visual method like storyboarding  is great for outlining out our presentation to help us create a roadmap of our ideas. Itâs great for using in the initial process of planning out a presentation"
74,Team 1,5,7 Ps Framework," Since we have been through our design process for five weeks, 7-Ps Framework can work as a checklist for us to organize our concepts and procedure before our final review. We can check what we lose and what else we can add on our project to make sure that we make everything perfect in the end. And since we are still not pretty sure about our targeted customers and marketing strategy, this method can help us have more concrete decision.", The team agreed that this method would clearly show our product and design process in presentation. We also felt that the 7-Ps Framework would be the perfect method to let us gain a clearer understanding of our main goal in limited time.
75,Team 2,5,Personas,"With module design, the medicine storage can be extended, and thus John has to refill it less. Using smart notification, the medicine box will play loud music and emit light to tell John itâs time to take medicine. Using phone apps, doctors and his children can clearly see whether he is on track. If not, the doctor will visit him and see if anything is wrong.  When itâs empty, John can press the Botton on it and later the doctor will come to refill it. The box also has location system. When itâs lost, the location can be seen on apps.
	With the box, John will never forget to take medicines and can easily receive help from doctors. His health condition can be ensured, so thus we achieved better treatment.","Our team made up a character to better improve our products. His name is John and is 65 years old. He lives in a nursing home but his children are working abroad, so thus he canât get daily care by his children. He has heart disease and has to take medicine every-day. He has got one medicine box now but its function is inefficient. It doesnât have notification functions and can only store medicines for five days. Also refilling it can be difficult, because John has to take it to the doctor. John then hope to have one medicine box with multi-functions. He want it notify him to take pills when he has to, because he always forgets to take after having fun poker games with his old friends. "
76,Team 2,5,Design Roadmap,"The factor we consider is easy to express how we think. By using this method, you can draw or even put photos together like a collage. When we are doing our project, the most imortant thing is to express your ideas really quick and exact. Also, it will be really great to track what you've done up till now to walk through your team's thinking progress at the end of the design. This also will help you finding out what's wrong with your design.",We wanted something that can track our process and help us firgure out what we have achieved so far. Design Roadmap is kind of method that can help us achiece this. It's kind of like a map journey we can use sketches and drawings  to show our thinkings.
77,Team 2,5,7 Ps Framework,"When we are choosing methods, we think that this method is really comprehensive and it includes all the information that we need to know and talk about. This method is like a guideline for us to develop our design.","It has a lot to do with purpose, product, people, process, pitfalls, prep, and practical. All of these Ps are really important when you are doing a design. You need to find out your users and their needs to achieve your goal. Also you need to get preparations and finally test it. All these contributes to a great design. So we decide on this method that can help us attain all these goals."
78,Team 3,5,Composite Characters,"Our team elected to use a composite character as we felt it was the most natural progression from that of the persona which helped to inform a significant portion of the design process.Considering how a product has evolved to suit the needs of many users, a composite character would allow us to synthesize many of the existing characteristics of our multiple personas in order to better provide context to the presentation.  A composite character would relay a clear understanding of the consumer that we are designing for and help to place our productâs features in a convenient juxtaposition with our product thus helping to tell the story of where features originated from and why they are relevant. In this way, the composite character can serve as a centralized guide from which the presentation is based, and via our constant relation to the character, our team can endeavor to create a clear link between the product and the consumer. As such, a composite character would be an excellent organizational tool, hence why our team has elected to select it.
","Our group firstly consider the university of our product, we hope our product could be widely applicable among international students in Berkeley. Michael figured out that composite character could help us consider multiple personas. Then we decide to use composite character to extend the character of our persona âMIngâ. "
79,Team 3,5,Storyboards,"The two primary reasons that our team decided to select the Storyboards was because of its explicitness and its explanatory power in presenting our product. We want the communication process could build connection with the model we built in build process. In last class, we use Adobe Illustrator build our main function for our product. But the picture could not directly present the user experience and feeling in practical application. We think storyboard which gives a holistic view of all user-touch points could present the true feeling of users to verify our functions. Furthermore, this method is extremely fun, could  inspire the  group involvement. The process of making storyboards is an interactive activity, we were all worried about the poor âHugoâ when he does not have the Visual Berkeley.His feeling becomes actual and touchable, 
","At very beginning, our team opted to using storyboards as one of  our communication methods just due to the talent of Imani. She is really good at drawing. Storyboards is a good way to show her capacity and get everyone involved in group communication. Everyone could have fun in this process. Second, storyboard could cooperate with our model built last class to present the core function of our product.
"
80,Team 3,5,Design Roadmap,"Danielle told us that the primary benefit of the design roadmapping method is that it promotes an active communication across participants to build their unique and structured plans for the future in phases from near to long. And design roadmpping is a map allow us to notice what the international students who is new in Berkeley really need. What's more, This new approach creates roadmaps driven by innovations from the perspective of future customers, instead of solely by technology projections.  This method of communication will provoke us to a headed discussion.  And in this way we can see our expectations for the next year.","Our team decided to use Design road mapping as our communication method. Make this decision is tough. After gust lecture, Danielle talked a lot of methods for communicationï¼specially introduced design road mapping method. Michael like this method. He said he familiar with project management and gold setting and he can do this well. Howeverï¼Hogo don't like this method. He said this method is very hard to operation compared with other method. But our team loves challengeï¼the more difficult problems areï¼the more interesting we are. And this method really suitable to our subject. So we choice this method."
81,Team 4,5,Personas,"We believe that personas are important in that they demonstrate our understanding of our customer base. Furthermore, once the initial basis is there, it allows us to clearly demonstrate how we may attend to the customer/userâs needs","Since we had used personas in our role play assignment, it was a logical extension to continue using it as a form of communication
"
82,Team 4,5,Storyboards,"As mentioned above, we valued the visual aspect of storyboarding - it offers a useful way of communicating within the team as well as customer without the miscommunication potential with words. Storyboarding also allows the display of detail that again is not possible with words.
",We wanted to ensure we included at least 1 visual communication method as they tend to be more engaging and efficient.
83,Team 4,5,Usability Report,"As mentioned previously, this method directly addresses user feedback. I think this is particularly valuable for our group as a lot of our design choices were based around the information we learned from our interviews. As such, the usability report seemed like a perfect method to convey what we learned from the interview and how we addressed it. 
","Our team found this method interesting in how it expressed direct user feedback and thus wanted to incorporate this into our project. 
"
84,Team 5,5,Envisionment Videos,We have members in our group that have experience in communicating through videos so this method was a good fit for us. Creating a video will allow us to gain insight into our customer's experience by envisioning what the usage of our product will look like. ,A few of us chose this method in our individual method surveys and we all agreed to it.
85,Team 5,5,Service Blueprint,"This method makes sense to use because our product is both tangible and digital, offering different features which address a multitude of pain points. It would allow us to better organize our features and center our business around understanding our customer's experiences.",Someone suggested this method and others agreed in a team chat.
86,Team 5,5,Design Roadmap,Our group has members which are apt at storytelling through visual charts and diagrams and this method would help us gain further insights from our user research. This method also makes sense to use at this stage in our design process given our lack of time because it focuses on augmenting our current features and designs rather than re-designing.,We had a team discussion and readily agreed to this method.
87,Team 6,5,Design Roadmap,"We believed that this is a great method to showcase our process of analyzing the observed data and quotes and converting them into actionable design decisions. It allowed us to sort our design journey into three threads, each corresponding to a unique customer/user segment, and it clearly showed how we responded to the unique challenges and contexts of each user group.
",We quickly agreed on using a design roadmap as we had just started this in class. We asked ourselves which methods we wanted to use and we all agreed upon using this method. 
88,Team 6,5,Storyboards,"We believed that this would be a great method to illustrate different scenarios that our product would be involved in and how it would work. We also thought we could put a twist on it by creating an interactive storyboard so the audience could experience the situation in a more first person context in order to induce more empathy. This would allow us to be more convincing since it forces users to be put onto the spot and experience the scenario themselves. This method would clearly communicate the problems that we are trying to solve and how important it is. 
","As a group, we discussed which all methods we had available to us and which methods we had chosen for our individual surveys and then came to a consensus on using a storyboard after light discussion.
"
89,Team 6,5,Composite Characters,"We believe that composite characters would help the audience understand what we are trying to achieve by empathizing with the user. We quickly realized that this method could also be used very well with a storyboard in order to make a very effective combination of the two. Since we talked to a lot of potential users with similar traits and backgrounds, we find it easier to composite a character than to focus on one specific character which is required in building personas. 
","As a group, we discussed which all methods we had available to us and came to a consensus on using composite characters after light discussion after realizing this was different enough from the other methods in order to not be redundant.
