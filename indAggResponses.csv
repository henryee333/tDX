83,S_1,1,2,Analysis,Context Mapping,M_18,False,"This method was a strong contender, but I think since our demographic is similar to us, we already have a strong understanding of the context in which we operate. If we sough to expand to new markets, then this would perhaps be a top priority.",False
84,S_1,1,2,Analysis,Customer Journey Mapping,M_19,False,"Without a clear product or service at this point, this method is not particularly relevant. As we develop something more concrete, perhaps this method will be worth revisiting in evaluating any potential gaps withing our product or service. ",False
85,S_1,1,2,Analysis,Empathy Map,M_20,False,"Since we largely chose to focus on younger adults and college students, I feel an empathy map is not as valuable as our target demographic is already one which we greatly relate to.

87,S_1,1,2,Analysis,Kano Analysis,M_22,False,"While, I did not choose this method due it perhaps being less useful to me because of its dependence on inference, it seems like it would be a useful analysis once we fully determined the features of our product.

93,S_1,1,2,Analysis,Touchpoint Matrix,M_28,True,"While this method was initially hard to understand and seems difficult to implement, as we move towards a more concrete design solution, I think the flows of the product or service it reveals will be helpful in seeing each team member's idea of the produce along with providing a clear understanding of how our product is meant to be used- which may help us evaluate better its effectiveness in how users' operate it.",False
94,S_1,1,2,Analysis,Why-How Laddering,M_29,False,"This method seems quite useful for broader topics and helps to narrow down the rationales for people's actions, but may not be the most suitable for more specific problems where the rationales may be more apparent.

96,S_1,1,3,Ideate,6-3-5 Brainwriting,M_31,True,"I mainly chose this since regular brain writing seems to be missing. Brainwriting, however, i feel would be a valuable method for our group as it tries to draw out responses from all the members of the group which will hopefully even out participation. Furthermore, it provides a fairly free-form, open foundation that is conducive to interesting and creative ideas. I am not entirely sure 6-3-5 brain writing specifically is the best form of brain writing, as it requires 6 people and its difficult to involve everyone in the process, so the time constraints may actually work against smaller groups in creating reduced ideation volume.

103,S_1,1,3,Ideate,Design Heuristics,M_38,False,"While I am not particularly familiar with this method, it seems to be an extremely guided method without as much freedom as the other methods.

104,S_1,1,3,Ideate,Design the Box,M_39,True,"I chose this mainly because it was a somewhat different, more fun method that dealt with more visual considerations. In creating tangible selling points for our product, I think we can better understand our goals for the solution.",False
105,S_1,1,3,Ideate,Do-Redo-Undo,M_40,False,"This method seems an interesting, less usual approach to design, but was also very difficult to fully grasp and so may be difficult to use. Furthermore, it requires an initial prototype to use, which we do not have at this point.",False

However, this is where the time restriction plays as another giant obstacle to keep us from gaining insights through this method.

1131,S_17,1,2,Analysis,Spectrum Mapping,M_26,True,"I believe this is a method that our team needs right now. First because I do not feel like our team is communicating as often as we should be and there are some silent members during discussion. The spectrum mapping, on one hand, makes everyone on the same page about how we analyze the subjects and categorize them, and on the other hand, eases communication and thoughts within a team.

I feel that this method could be very practical and useful to implement in the current challenge that we face during the 1:1s.

Additionally, I think 6-up works well given the limited time we have to complete our project. I like how open the method is, and it would allow us to explore different paths to ideation.

1671,S_25,1,4,Build,Experience Prototyping,M_46,False,This method needs to make multiple prototypes to test the experience of different aspects of the design. It is also hard to make ideal context.,False
1672,S_25,1,4,Build,Fused Deposition Modelling,M_47,False,"It is similar to laminated object and is slower. And FDM  only can use  glass, ceramics and thermoplastics when building models.",False
1673,S_25,1,4,Build,Laminated Object Manufacturing,M_48,True,"LOM is inexpensive and simple. Since our product is still at conceptual stage and it doesn't have  many complicated details , this method can help us create models more quickly.",False
1674,S_25,1,4,Build,Laser Cutting,M_49,False,Laser Cutting will consume a lot of energy and it can only cut 2-dimensional sheet materials. It may be dangerous to cut metals and plastics.,False
1675,S_25,1,4,Build,Prototyping,M_50,True,"I can make my idea tangible and real. And it can help reduce the risk of costly development,  testing whether the product works as expected.",False
1676,S_25,1,4,Build,Rapid Prototyping,M_51,False,"It needs some skill to use  laser cutter, water jet cutter, or 3-D printer and it is difficult to have access to those tools. Besides, our project is still vague and undefined. So using this method is not appropriate now.",False
1677,S_25,1,4,Build,Service Prototyping,M_52,False,Participants are role-playing so they may not be wholly accurate. It will be different from real-life situation.,False
1678,S_25,1,4,Build,Tangible Prototyping,M_53,True,Materials for this method such as cardboard and foam are cheap and easy to find. It does not require technical skills. And we can get feedback from other team members and improve our design.,False
1679,S_25,1,4,Build,Water Jet Cutting,M_54,False,"I may ruin my design if the material I use is too thicker or if I  input the cutter guide paths in an incorrect manner, cutting composite materials without first doing some precutting.",False
1680,S_25,1,4,Build,Wireframe,M_55,False,This method is limited to more interaction and it needs a lot of details and symbolic elements or it will be confusing. I prefer method that includes more discussion and exchanging thoughts.,False
1681,S_25,1,5,Communicate,7Ps Framework,M_56,False,"It looks a little similar to Business model canvas. Besides, skipping any steps  won_Ñét guarantee a full picture. Each P should be considered completely.",False
1682,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Business Model Canvas,M_57,True,"It is quick to make and easy to understand, showing a clear form to customers.",False
1683,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Composite Characters,M_58,False,Combining characters into one user can be a difficult process and we may be sidelined by unimportant  character and waste time.,False
1684,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Design Roadmap,M_59,False,We may  receive ineffective feedback from others. Our first version of product concept is not very clear yet.,False
1685,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Envisionment Video,M_60,False,"It takes time to make a video. Besides, we have to portray a holistic view of the customer experience in it.",False
1686,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Personas,M_61,True,"It can separate  our team from the users, allowing  richer communication of user requirements.",False
1687,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Service Blueprint,M_62,False,May be hard to interpret with a lack of visual image and does not include many process details.,False
1688,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Storyboard,M_63,True,It is an interactive activity that every team member can easily participate in and it can spark creative ideas.,False
1689,S_25,1,5,Communicate,Usability Report,M_64,False,It can be ineffective if all points are not be explained properly. We have to be very familiar with the data.,False
